During one of the visits to Arizona in September, I was worried.

What do I say?  
What if I say the wrong thing?

However, when I met and talked with him, I realized that I was worrying needlessly.

He comforted me and talked about being hopeful and having faith in Jesus Christ, our Savior.

Realized once again that wisdom and insight is not gained by living longer or experiencing more but having a reverence (fear) of God.

## Spencer had answers

Spencer has always lifted me.

Usually through a conversation about a topic that I had questions on.

Whether it was the national stage or local elections, he would take me through the issues, candidates, all at a level that I could readily understand.

Then when the topic was sports, it didn't matter whether it was the college conference realignment or some obscure players, he not only knew all the relevant facts, but he could also formulate the reason and therefore strategy for the future.

It really didn't matter what the topic was, for he was always prepared to provide a response, a suggestion, customized for that moment and the person.

In addition, we usually discussed current events and the state of the world and how to view it and what are some alternatives to improve.

Before providing the answer, he would assess my understanding of the issue.  Then he would, in a thoughtful and kind manner, explain the issue more fully and then offer some alternatives.

Now days, alternate or artificial intelligence is the center of many discussions.

AI has surpassed my understanding and will develop further.  

However, it will not reach the level of understanding the needs of the person, to tailor its response, quite the way Spencer was able to.

For all the learning, or Large Language Modelling, will not create an understanding of an individual.

Perhaps the warning to Timothy from Paul applies,

> Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.

## Spencer as a healer

Spencer was blessed to understand where you stood, what issues you faced and how you felt.

With that understanding, he was able to remove all barriers to knowledge of the truth.

With the path to the truth established, I was able to learn, and at times be healed from the incorrect understanding and behavior that was affecting me and those around me.

These practices may have been hurtful, ignorance, or prejudices that I had carried as a burden.

Thank you Spencer for making the burden lighter.

Without recognition or reward, Spencer served those around him.

I am one of the many beneficiaries.

As his center, his model did a long ago, Spencer fed his flock like a shepherd

Pray that I will remember his examples.

And when I do remember them, that I will act in a way that will be like Him, as was Spencer.

Thank you Spencer.

You will always be in our hearts and minds and reflected in our actions.
