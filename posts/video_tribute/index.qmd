Hi President & Sister Irvine, ðŸ’—

I just wanted to write you a note and tell you how thankful I am for you and for having you as such amazing senior missionaries.

I loved the aprons & always delicious food & acts of service & love while I was in Washington D.C.!

I especially loved the sack lunches you would make us for zone conferences & the handmade masks when I was brand new to the mission back in august of 2020.

They made me have so much joy! ðŸ’—

I was so sad to hear about your son passing away.

I am praying for you & Sister Irvine & your family and hope you have comfort & peace.

Thank you for making missionary life better in a time that a lot of the time felt really dark & dreary.

I hope you & your family are able to feel loved & fortified.

ðŸ’— love you

President & Sister Irvine!!! ðŸ’—

-   Sister `D`
