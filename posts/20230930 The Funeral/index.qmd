## How Great Thou Art[^1]

[^1]: https://hymnary.org/hymn/LDS1985/86

1.  O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder Consider all the *worlds thy hands have made, I see the stars, I hear the* rolling thunder, Thy pow'r thru-out the universe displayed;

\[Chorus\]

*Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee, How great thou art! How great thou art! Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee, How great thou art! How great thou art!*

2.  When thru the woods and forest glades I wander, And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees, When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze, \[Chorus\]

3.  And when I think that God, his Son not sparing, Sent him to die, I scarce can take it in, That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing, He bled and died to take away my sin, \[Chorus\]

4.  When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation, And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart! Then I shall bow in humble adoration And there proclaim, "My God, how great thou art!" \[Chorus\]

## Families can be Together, Forever[^2]

[^2]: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/music/library/hymns/families-can-be-together-forever?lang=eng

I have a fam'ly here on earth.

They are so good to me.

I want to share my life with them through all eternity.

\[Chorus\]

*Fam'lies can be together forever*

*Through Heav'nly Father's plan.*

*I always want to be with my own family,*

*And the Lord has shown me how I can.*

*The Lord has shown me how I can.*

While I am in my early years,

I'll prepare most carefully,

So I can marry in God's temple for eternity.

## Battle Hymn of the Republic[^3]

[^3]: https://www.austincc.edu/dlauderb/1302/Lyrics/BattleHymnoftheRepublic.htm

Mine eyes have seen the glory Of the coming of the Lord; He is trampling out the vintage Where the grapes of wrath are stored; He hath loosed the fateful lightning Of His terrible swift sword; His truth is marching on.

Chorus

*Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.*

I have seen Him in the watchfires Of a hundred circling camps They have builded Him an altar In the evening dews and damps; I can read His righteous sentence By the dim and flaring lamps; His day is marching on.

*Chorus Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.*

He has sounded forth the trumpet That shall never call retreat; He is sifting out the hearts of men Before His judgement seat; Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; Be jubilant, my feet; Our God is marching on.

*Chorus Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on*.

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea, With a glory in His bosom That transfigures you and me; As He died to make men holy, Let us die to make men free; While God is marching on.

*Chorus Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on*.
