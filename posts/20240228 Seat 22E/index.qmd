Traveling to Mesa from Provo on a commercial airline was not an option for a long time

During the time I have lived in Provo, the only practical option was either drive through Panguitch or Las Vegas.

One can drive up to SLC and fly to Phoenix but that option was reserved for business travels.

Then an airline provided a direct service between Provo and Mesa. ^[Allegiant began its service on or around February 15, 2013]

This time, I didn't even have a carry-on or a backpack.
I was visiting Mesa regularly and had left most needful items in AZ.

I was carrying a tote bag my sister had made for me.
A stylish Mandalorian themed one at that.

I was hoping for a less than a full flight.
Things were looking good, odds were in my favor, I had the whole right side of row 22 to myself.

Two ladies walked down to where I was and one of them pointed to the middle seat next to me.
One with the headphone climbed to the window seat.

The lady in the middle seat began to ask probing questions,

> What brings you to Arizona?

Regretted not packing the ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) Headphone.

Not to be anti-social, I gave a vague, evasive answer.

She sensed my hesistancy.  
Answering her own question, she was going to the Sisters Only retreat to Tucson.  
Following a funeral of her sister in Salt Lake City.

Before I could ask a follow up question, she elaborated.  
She passed away from breast cancer at age 40, leaving behind 2 children and a husband.

She then explained that her parents were strict with children and some of the children rebelled.

I don't if I would share all those to a passenger that I just met.

Hearing her family story softened my heart and I told her that I was going to Phoenix to attend a family funeral.

Furthermore, she touched on struggles she and her husband have had.

She accepted the transition from this life to another as a necessary transformation.

By now the plane had begun its descent and was circling the Valley of the Sun.

I was grateful that Patricia and I shared the time on that flight.
Without knowing, she had taken on my burden as well as her own.

By sharing her recent challenges and our seeming random encounter, she had reminded me that God is aware and directing our lives.

> What are the odds of 2 people out of 200 or so passengers that were experiencing the same challenge of losing a family member to cancer.

A speaker talked about Spencer's penchant for speaking to passengers on a plane.

Thank you Spencer and Patricia for arranging that meeting on Breeze Airway #620 and leading me into a better state of mind and understanding.

> And that I long for freedom!
And that I long, and that I long for freedom!
