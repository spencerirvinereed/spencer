- When did you first meet Spencer (Elder Irvine)?

I believe I first met Elder Irvine in 2009. I was in Van Nuys Ward at that time.

---

- What was your impression when you first met Elder Irvine and Erickson?

When I opened my door, I felt like Elder Irvine and Elder Erickson were literally messengers from God.    
They radiated goodness and love, so sweet and kind and excited to share the Gospel with me.

---

- Could you describe Elder Irvine reaction, when you told him, you have been waiting for them?

Initially, I think my welcoming response, was totally unexpected to them. 

And then he asked me why I said that.

I told him, I assumed my sister had given them my address.  

She never gave up on me. 

Cory, my sister, and I are very close.  

She told me once that the only gift she wanted from me was to be temple worthy so I could be sealed to our parents. 

My life had not been the best.

- Do you recall an instance when Elder Irvine provided a Christ-like service?

The day he gave me my scriptures I cried. 

I hadn’t had my own scriptures for 30 years. 

I cried when I read the inscription: 

> “Dear Betsy,  
Great treasures of hidden wisdom are contained in this book. 

>I know the truths in the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price will sustain you in your life’s trials. God will always be there for us. 

>You are great! 
God loves you. 
He wants you to be happy. 
He is your Father in Heaven. 
Take good care of yourself, and God will provide for you.
 
>Love,
Elder Spencer Irvine

- What do you think is the purpose of the missionary work, as practiced in the LDS church? 

I believe that missionary work is to provide a way for us to return to our Father in Heaven.   
It is up to us to listen and accept it.   
They need to be true examples of Christ in all they do.

- Some words for the family of Elder Irvine.

Even though Spencer was truly a messenger from God, he was also very funny.  

When the missionaries were working with me, they were at my house three or four times a week. 
They helped me decorate for holidays.. 

He especially loved all my Halloween decorations. 

Spencer taught me that even though I live by myself, I am never alone. 
My Savior is always with me. 

As I write this tears stream down my face thinking of what the world has lost, but at the same time I am delighted in knowing Spencer is experiencing the Glory of God, as he continues to teach and waits to embrace those he loves as they join him in the eternities.

Thank you for this opportunity to express my feelings.   
Please give Don a hug for me, I truly enjoyed meeting him.

May God bless you all in your time of grief and know that he and Spencer are smiling down on us each and every day.
