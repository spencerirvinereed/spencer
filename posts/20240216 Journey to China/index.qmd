Four adults and 7 children are boarding a plane.

My mother, my sister and her 3 children.

My wife and my 4 children are traveling to 北京.

![](images/009.jpg)Surprisingly, this city of 3 million has a direct flight to our destination.

With 11 of us, we take up a whole row and then some.

When we arrive in Beijing, we are led by a Korean Chinese man.

The restaurants featured great food and some local entertainment as well.

I remember some of the food were spicy and most of us were drinking water and soda to wash down the meal.

## First stop 天安門 square

We get to see things we only read about or imagined.

A mind and soul enlarging visit.

Learned that emperors fulfilled the role of speaking on behalf of the people to Heavens.

Usually praying for the successful harvest.

Had forgotten much of details about this trip.

We had taken several hours of video, during this 3 day visit as a family.

Great to recall that visit to China, during the first part of August in the year 2000.
