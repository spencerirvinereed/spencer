## How Great Thou Art[^1]

[^1]: https://hymnary.org/hymn/LDS1985/86

1.  O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder Consider all the *worlds thy hands have made, I see the stars, I hear the* rolling thunder, Thy pow'r thru-out the universe displayed;

\[Chorus\]

*Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee, How great thou art! How great thou art! Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee, How great thou art! How great thou art!*

2.  When thru the woods and forest glades I wander, And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees, When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze, \[Chorus\]

3.  And when I think that God, his Son not sparing, Sent him to die, I scarce can take it in, That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing, He bled and died to take away my sin, \[Chorus\]

4.  When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation, And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart! Then I shall bow in humble adoration And there proclaim, "My God, how great thou art!" \[Chorus\]

## Families can be Together, Forever[^2]

[^2]: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/music/library/hymns/families-can-be-together-forever?lang=eng

I have a fam'ly here on earth.

They are so good to me.

I want to share my life with them through all eternity.

\[Chorus\]

*Fam'lies can be together forever*

*Through Heav'nly Father's plan.*

*I always want to be with my own family,*

*And the Lord has shown me how I can.*

*The Lord has shown me how I can.*

While I am in my early years,

I'll prepare most carefully,

So I can marry in God's temple for eternity.

## Battle Hymn of the Republic[^3]

[^3]: https://www.austincc.edu/dlauderb/1302/Lyrics/BattleHymnoftheRepublic.htm

Mine eyes have seen the glory Of the coming of the Lord; He is trampling out the vintage Where the grapes of wrath are stored; He hath loosed the fateful lightning Of His terrible swift sword; His truth is marching on.

Chorus

*Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.*

I have seen Him in the watchfires Of a hundred circling camps They have builded Him an altar In the evening dews and damps; I can read His righteous sentence By the dim and flaring lamps; His day is marching on.

*Chorus Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.*

He has sounded forth the trumpet That shall never call retreat; He is sifting out the hearts of men Before His judgement seat; Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; Be jubilant, my feet; Our God is marching on.

*Chorus Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on*.

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea, With a glory in His bosom That transfigures you and me; As He died to make men holy, Let us die to make men free; While God is marching on.

*Chorus Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on*.

### Bishop McCormack

We have a few speakers this morning.

First, the tribute to Spencer by his sister, Kristy Tidwell.

We will then pause to hear John and Sarah Gonzales singing my shepherd.

Following the musical number, a eulogy will be given by Steven Irvine. Following Stephen, Alfredo Lopez, (Spencer's friend), will say a few words.

### Kristy Irvine

My hope and prayer today is that the the spirit can be with me.

To help me get through this.

It took a long time for me to think about how I could give Spencer, a proper tribute to, who he was.

My dear brother Spencer left this mortality too soon, but not without making his mark in this world.

He lived his life in accordance with the principles that he knew to be true and aligned his life with the will of our savior Jesus Christ.

I think that it can be said of him, that like Nephi

> I glory in plainness,\
> I glory in truth, I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul.

Spencer loved the Gospel of Jesus Christ and embodied it, and in all that he did. Even as a child, he could recognize true principles and devoted his life to the savior and our Heavenly Father.

He was a black and white kind of guy. He could see right. And he knew when things were wrong.

One of my favorite things that we talked about this week was, that even in preschool, when he was interviewed for a new story about missing school, he told the reporter that he missed school because he wanted to play.

And those were facts.

There's a small section of a talk given by Michelle Craig that I would like to read because we can insert Spencer's name into it and see him in it, she says.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"When hard times come, I try to remember that I chose to follow Christ before I came to Earth and that challenges to my faith, my health and my endurance are all part of the reason I'm here.

And I certainly should never think that today's trial calls into question God's love for me or let it turn my faith in him into doubt.

Trials do not mean that the plan is failing.

They are part of the plan, meant to help me seek God.

I become more like him when I endure patiently and hopefully like him when in agony.

I pray more earnestly.

Jesus Christ was the perfect example of loving our father with all his heart, of doing his will and regardless of the cost, I want to follow his his example by doing the same"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Spencer embodied so many Christ-like attributes throughout his short time here on Earth.

He was full of faith in Jesus Christ.

He fully accepted him as his personal Savior and Redeemer, and looked to Him in all things.

In `Preach My Gospel`, which is a guide for all members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

It says that faith leads to action, and when you have faith in Jesus Christ, you accomplish what the Lord wants you to accomplish. And you help bring about good in your own life and the lives of others.

Spencer was always doing good in his life. He served others.

He remembered birthdays. He apologized for not remembering birthdays.

And he was always one to help when needed. Spencer was full of hope. He hoped for a better future for himself and Meg, and always look forward, not back.

He was patient, optimistic and persevered through his multiple surgeries, injuries, his recent diagnosis.

And in every trial that he faced, his eye was fixed firmly upon the Savior.

President James E Faust taught, `hope is the anchor of our souls`.

Spencer lived his life full of hope.

A man once asked Jesus which is the great commandment in the law.

Jesus replied,

> Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment, and the second is like unto it. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.

Spencer did this his entire life.

He put the Lord first.

His friends knew what he stood for and what he wouldn't say or do.

Spencer listened to those around him and loved them unconditionally.

He served a full time mission in California, and his letters were always full of love for those around him.

Whenever I would text Spencer, he was quick to offer a kind word.

He supported me with love and was slow to anger.

His life was a life of charity, the pure love of Christ was part of who he was.

Spencer was a true disciple of Christ.

Elder De Feo. said in a talk entitled `Pure Love`, the true sign of every disciple of Jesus Christ said[^4].

[^4]: [link](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/04/pure-love-the-true-sign-of-every-true-disciple-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng)

> True disciples love to submit themselves to the Lord with peace in their heart. They are humble and submissive because they love him. They have faith to fully accept his will, not only in what he does, but also in how and when.

> True disciples know that the real blessings are not always what they want, but rather what the Lord wants for them.

His humility and willingness to submit to the will of The Lord was and is inspiring.

Spencer went through periods of unemployment which to us is very disappointing and many when faced with this challenge can become despondent and even quick to anger with the Lord for not helping answer prayers for good employment.

Spencer did everything that he could to provide for himself and Meg, even taking jobs that were not equal to his education or talents.

But they were jobs that would allow him to provide. His humility and submission to the Lord, yielded great results with a job that Spencer truly loved.

Elder De Feo also said `pure love is the true sign of every true disciple of Jesus Christ`.

I'm sure many of you have memories of Spencer embodying this statement. His love was pure, it was unfettered from judgment and hostility.

He was a happy person who loved unconditionally.

He laughed with so manym he welcomed all.

He threw himself into youth activities and was always the first to offer a smile, tell a good joke and ask if anyone needed help.

Spencer loved his family.

He devoted his time to his sweetheart, Meg, and gave her everything that he could offer and the circumstances that they lived in.

He loved everything about his nieces and nephews.

And would gush over their photos and celebrate their accomplishments and encourage them when I would tell him of a struggle in their life.

In closing, I want to share a few thoughts on the resurrection. As we look to that day with longing and hope of seeing our dear Spencer again

The following is taken from a talk called `Sunday Will Come`, by Elder Wirthlin[^5].

[^5]: [link](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2006/10/sunday-will-come?lang=eng)

> President Joseph F. Smith said "that those from whom we have to part here, we will meet again and see as they are. We will meet the same identical being that we associated with here in the flesh."

> President Spencer W. Kimball amplified this when he said, "I am sure that if we can imagine ourselves at our very best, physically, mentally, spiritually, that is the way we will come back."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

"When Christ rose from the grave, becoming the firstfruits of the Resurrection, He made that gift available to all. And with that sublime act, He softened the devastating, consuming sorrow that gnaws at the souls of those who have lost precious loved ones.

I think of how dark that Friday was when Christ was lifted up on the cross.

On that terrible Friday the earth shook and grew dark. Frightful storms lashed at the earth.

Those evil men who sought His life rejoiced. Now that Jesus was no more, surely those who followed Him would disperse. On that day they stood triumphant.

On that day the veil of the temple was rent in twain.

Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Jesus, were both overcome with grief and despair. The superb man they had loved and honored hung lifeless upon the cross.

On that Friday the Apostles were devastated. Jesus, their Savior---the man who had walked on water and raised the dead---was Himself at the mercy of wicked men. They watched helplessly as He was overcome by His enemies.

On that Friday the Savior of mankind was humiliated and bruised, abused and reviled.

It was a Friday filled with devastating, consuming sorrow that gnawed at the souls of those who loved and honored the Son of God.

I think that of all the days since the beginning of this world's history, that Friday was the darkest.

But the doom of that day did not endure.

The despair did not linger because on Sunday, the resurrected Lord burst the bonds of death. He ascended from the grave and appeared gloriously triumphant as the Savior of all mankind.

And in an instant the eyes that had been filled with ever-flowing tears dried. The lips that had whispered prayers of distress and grief now filled the air with wondrous praise, for Jesus the Christ, the Son of the living God, stood before them as the firstfruits of the Resurrection, the proof that death is merely the beginning of a new and wondrous existence.

Each of us will have our own Fridays---those days when the universe itself seems shattered and the shards of our world lie littered about us in pieces. We all will experience those broken times when it seems we can never be put together again. We will all have our Fridays.

But I testify to you in the name of the One who conquered death---Sunday will come. In the darkness of our sorrow, Sunday will come.

No matter our desperation, no matter our grief, Sunday will come. In this life or the next, Sunday will come."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

My hope is that as Spencer passed through the veil, he could he could hear the words of Paul in his mind.

> The time in my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith.

May we all remember our dear friend Spencer and the compass that he used to guide his life, the Savior, Jesus Christ.

May we take the example that Spencer set for us and following the Savior that we may invite the Savior more fully into our lives and willingly give our shortcomings to him that he may help us be perfect in Him.

My testimony is that Sunday will come that glorious day when we will be reunited with those we love and rejoice in the great gift that the Savior has given us through his sacrifice in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.
