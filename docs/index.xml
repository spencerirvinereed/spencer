<p>That time we traveled from Maryland to Utah<br>
How long ago was it?</p>
<p>We made the visit as a family.</p>
<p>First to Utah then a visit Arizona.</p>
<p>The journey took several days, since we drove.</p>
<p>My sister and I took turn driving.</p>
<p>My mom and dad in the back seats with your sister in the middle,</p>
<p>You in the front middle seat.</p>
<p>We attended a graduation in Provo Utah</p>
<p><img src="https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/20240212 First Trip/m1.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Then we drove to meet my sister in Scottsdale.</p>
<p>Thank you and your sister for coming with us on that journey.</p>
<p>You didn’t have choice.</p>
<p>You were only 6 months old.</p>
<p>You were patient, demonstrating those qualities very early.</p>
<p>Thanks for being part of that journey many many years ago<br>
We enjoyed that time together as we drove out.</p>
<p>Most flew back home, leaving Grandpa and me to drive the Olds 88 back home.</p>
<p>It was good to drive with Grandpa as we drove through Texas and beyond. We drove and reminisced through I-81 and rain.</p>
<p>Since then, we have enjoyed many more journeys with you.</p>
<p>But that first one, we all marveled at qualities you possessed. My mom and dad expressed their appreciation to you and your sister for travelling so well.</p>
<p>Thank you Spencer, for that memory from August of 1988.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Merging onto the University Avenue from the 2230 North can seem like a driving in a blend line in a race track, joining the race from the pit lane (2230 N) to race track (Univ. Ave).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The pace and drama depends on the car one is driving and the horsepower or more accurately, the acceleration of the car.</p>
<p>One constant is the view of Timpanogos.</p>
<p><img src="https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/20231229 Love We Remember/main.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<hr>
<p>On this day, returning to office, after an extended holiday time off, was feeling nostalgic in the Subaru that has been in the family since the beginning of this century.</p>
<p>The nostalgia due to its array of CD Changer, a cassette player, and a FM receiver with 12 preset stations.</p>
<p>Utah Valley has an abundance of FM station that perfectly serves those of us that experienced the latter half of the past century.</p>
<p>There is Classical 89 that has morning, afternoon and evening hosts. (89.1 or 89.5 MHz in Provo/Orem Area)</p>
<p>The one that plays soft hits from decades in 1900s. Classy FM. (99.1 MHz in Provo/Orem Area)</p>
<p>Then the new station, that used to call itself GOAT-FM, is now Flashback 96.7 (MHz)</p>
<hr>
<p>With the view of Timpanogos fading, the cars transitioned into another blend line (800 North in Orem), after showing off cars agility.</p>
<p>The Flashback FM played a melody that foreshadowed a great song.</p>
<p>After an intro that lasted nearly a minute, singers harmonized then the lead singer began.</p>
<p>Recognized the singer right away but I had not heard this song and almost forgotten it existed.</p>
<p><img src="https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/20231229 Love We Remember/main2.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<hr>
<p>At the office, tried to look up the song using some of the lines from the song.</p>
<p>Took a while, thanks to algorithms, the song was found.</p>
<p>Some would classify this as a Rhythm and Blues, Soul, Funk or even Disco.</p>
<p>But great songs defy classification and create its own class.</p>
<p>This should be classified as <code>Songs about Life</code></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1UkbZebiXQ">Link to Love I Lost</a></p>
<hr>
<p>One level, the song captures the pains of separation with words and music.</p>
<p>Teddy Pendergrass is an unique, generational talent.<br>
Background singers, the arrangement and mastering. A perfect blend, a music from a bygone era.</p>
<hr>
<p>At another level, the song invokes memories of something lost (faded away) or given up as one ages.</p>
<p>At times, life takes (and we follow) a direction not anticipated and not appreciated.</p>
<p>It would be helpful and assuring to find a reason that explains why certain events occur. Why certain people appear and are separated from us.</p>
<p><img src="https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/20231229 Love We Remember/main3.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<hr>
<p>Until those questions are answered, the life and its meaning seem distant and not applicable.</p>
<p>But in someways we find comfort and meaning in having had the chance to experience all facets of this life, form relationships, moreover create memories that will outlive this temporal existence.</p>
<p>And occasionally, a song that triggers memory of life in simpler days.</p>
<p>Appreciate the FM Technology, and those stations that stream, the old fashioned way.</p>
<p>Thank you Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff for writing the song. Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes for recording the song. Musicians and technicians for preserving this piece.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>Kenny and Leon,</p>
<p>Would it be OK if we changed the wording slightly.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The Love We Remember The Faith That Guided Them Those Memories We Cherish</p>
<p>We will never let go</p>

  <title>Rest In My Heart</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>While driving to meet Sister K for lunch<br>
Tuned into a FM Station, a preset station, lower on the frequency spectrum.</p>
<p>Heard a voice, instead of music, on that classical FM station.</p>
<p>The voice had characteristics not often heard in these parts<br>
Yet the message was familiar and soothing.<br>
The voice sounded like someone from the Eastern United States was speaking</p>
<p><img src="https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/20231226 In our hearts/main1.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>The speaker was Rabbi Ari Berman of Yeshiva University.</p>
<p>Speaking at a BYU Forum Assembly.</p>
<p>The topic was <code>Covenant versus Consumer Education</code>.</p>
<p>He described the difference between the two.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>…the consumer focuses on the I and what’s missing from life creating a mechanism for fundamental unhappiness<br>
while the covenant is focused on the we guiding one to contemplate their lives in a broader sense of memory and purpose in the service of others</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He touched on the mission of YU.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>the covenantal perspective is predicated on the notion that everyone has a place within the covenants and our educational mission is to help our students discover their own story and experience within our larger one</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/20231226 In our hearts/main2.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>He also quoted Joseph B. Soloveitchik</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>one trait which I do possess is my inability to imitate anyone else I always want to be myself and to display my unique dignity of having been created in the image of God the glory of the individual is exemplified by the Singularity of every human being</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also spoke of his father’s passing 10 weeks before.</p>
<p>His father “…was a man with great force and great spirit it was hard to see him (decline) over these past couple years”</p>
<p>They were memorializing the eternal resting place in Israel</p>
<p>Rabbi Berman states,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I knew that this did not truly capture my reality because my father does not rest in the ground he Rest In My Heart and I carry him with me Wherever I Go</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He further states,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>we will Faithfully continue to transmit the terms of the Covenant to our children and grandchildren spreading God’s word and infusing the world with God’s spirit</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Grateful for that message delivered in January this year. I needed to hear this personalized message.</p>
<p>Thank you Rabbi Berman,</p>
<p>Thank you KBYU-FM and BYU for hosting the program. Also grateful for the technology that provides both audio/vido and a trascription service.</p>
<p>Thank you mom and dad.</p>
<p>For teaching us how to live and serve.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>During one of the visits to Arizona in September, I was worried.</p>
<p>What do I say?<br>
What if I say the wrong thing?</p>
<p>However, when I met and talked with him, I realized that I was worrying needlessly.</p>
<p>He comforted me and talked about being hopeful and having faith in Jesus Christ, our Savior.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/20231223 Remembering/main5.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Realized once again that wisdom and insight is not gained by living longer or experiencing more but having a reverence (fear) of God.</p>
<section id="spencer-had-answers" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spencer-had-answers">Spencer had answers</h2>
<p>Spencer has always lifted me.</p>
<p>Usually through a conversation about a topic that I had questions on.</p>
<p>Whether it was the national stage or local elections, he would take me through the issues, candidates, all at a level that I could readily understand.</p>
<p>Then when the topic was sports, it didn’t matter whether it was the college conference realignment or some obscure players, he not only knew all the relevant facts, but he could also formulate the reason and therefore strategy for the future.</p>
<p>It really didn’t matter what the topic was, for he was always prepared to provide a response, a suggestion, customized for that moment and the person.</p>
<table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 5%">
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><img src="https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/20231223 Remembering/main.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>In addition, we usually discussed current events and the state of the world and how to view it and what are some alternatives to improve.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Before providing the answer, he would assess my understanding of the issue. Then he would, in a thoughtful and kind manner, explain the issue more fully and then offer some alternatives.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now days, alternate or artificial intelligence is the center of many discussions.</p>
<p>AI has surpassed my understanding and will develop further.</p>
<p>However, it will not reach the level of understanding the needs of the person, to tailor its response, quite the way Spencer was able to.</p>
<p>For all the learning, or Large Language Modelling, will not create an understanding of an individual.</p>
<p>Perhaps the warning to Timothy from Paul applies,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/20231223 Remembering/main2.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
</section>
<section id="spencer-as-a-healer" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spencer-as-a-healer">Spencer as a healer</h2>
<p>Spencer was blessed to understand where you stood, what issues you faced and how you felt.</p>
<p>With that understanding, he was able to remove all barriers to knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>With the path to the truth established, I was able to learn, and at times be healed from the incorrect understanding and behavior that was affecting me and those around me.</p>
<p>These practices may have been hurtful, ignorance, or prejudices that I had carried as a burden.</p>
<p>Thank you Spencer for making the burden lighter.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/20231223 Remembering/main3.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Without recognition or reward, Spencer served those around him.</p>
<p>I am one of the many beneficiaries.</p>
<p>As his center, his model did a long ago, Spencer fed his flock like a shepherd</p>
<hr>
<p>Pray that I will remember his examples.</p>
<p>And when I do remember them, that I will act in a way that will be like Him, as was Spencer.</p>
<p>Thank you Spencer.</p>
<p>You will always be in our hearts and minds and reflected in our actions.</p>

  <title>My Memories of Spencer</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<ul>
<li>When did you first meet Spencer (Elder Irvine)?</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe I first met Elder Irvine in 2009. I was in Van Nuys Ward at that time.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>What was your impression when you first met Elder Irvine and Erickson?</li>
</ul>
<p>When I opened my door, I felt like Elder Irvine and Elder Erickson were literally messengers from God.<br>
They radiated goodness and love, so sweet and kind and excited to share the Gospel with me.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Could you describe Elder Irvine reaction, when you told him, you have been waiting for them?</li>
</ul>
<p>Initially, I think my welcoming response, was totally unexpected to them.</p>
<p>And then he asked me why I said that.</p>
<p>I told him, I assumed my sister had given them my address.</p>
<p>She never gave up on me.</p>
<p>Cory, my sister, and I are very close.</p>
<p>She told me once that the only gift she wanted from me was to be temple worthy so I could be sealed to our parents.</p>
<p>My life had not been the best.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/Betsy Miller/temple.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<ul>
<li>What helped (prepared) you to meet these Elders and welcome them into your home?</li>
</ul>
<p>There really was no preparation.<br>
I hadn’t consciously thought about it.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>What was it about Elder Irvine that made you trust in him?</li>
</ul>
<p>Elder Irvine was one of the genuinely nicest people I ever met.<br>
He radiated the spirit of the Lord.<br>
He was truly concerned about me.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>What Christ-like qualities did E. Irvine possess?</li>
</ul>
<p>Elder Irvine demonstrated these Christlike qualities</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>He loved our Heavenly Father.</li>
<li>He had charity in his heart,</li>
<li>He was kind to everyone.</li>
<li>He was reverent when teaching me.</li>
<li>He was an excellent teacher</li>
<li>He knew that his mission was a blessing from God.</li>
<li>Mostly, he was very patient with me.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Do you recall an instance when Elder Irvine provided a Christ-like service?</li>
</ul>
<p>The day he gave me my scriptures I cried.</p>
<p>I hadn’t had my own scriptures for 30 years.</p>
<p>I cried when I read the inscription:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>“Dear Betsy,<br>
Great treasures of hidden wisdom are contained in this book.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I know the truths in the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price will sustain you in your life’s trials. God will always be there for us.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You are great! God loves you. He wants you to be happy. He is your Father in Heaven. Take good care of yourself, and God will provide for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Love, Elder Spencer Irvine</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>What do you think is the purpose of the missionary work, as practiced in the LDS church?</li>
</ul>
<p>I believe that missionary work is to provide a way for us to return to our Father in Heaven.<br>
It is up to us to listen and accept it.<br>
They need to be true examples of Christ in all they do.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Some words for the family of Elder Irvine.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though Spencer was truly a messenger from God, he was also very funny.</p>
<p>When the missionaries were working with me, they were at my house three or four times a week. They helped me decorate for holidays..</p>
<p>He especially loved all my Halloween decorations.</p>
<p>Spencer taught me that even though I live by myself, I am never alone. My Savior is always with me.</p>
<p>As I write this tears stream down my face thinking of what the world has lost, but at the same time I am delighted in knowing Spencer is experiencing the Glory of God, as he continues to teach and waits to embrace those he loves as they join him in the eternities.</p>
<p>Thank you for this opportunity to express my feelings.<br>
Please give Don a hug for me, I truly enjoyed meeting him.</p>
<p>May God bless you all in your time of grief and know that he and Spencer are smiling down on us each and every day.</p>
<ul>

<p>In the universe of sports and history coverage, there is no shortage of outlets that tells (and shows) what has happened.</p>
<p>Far less in supply are those that explain how and why it happened.</p>
<p>Even fewer are those that give meaning to the event as well as how it might apply to our daily lives.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are similarities between sports and history. It is possible to enjoy both as participants and as spectators.</p>
<p>That is why Spencer enjoyed and excelled in both. Because he was a student and a participant (in the case of football and other sports)</p>
<p>Both involve strategy and tactical implementation or execution.</p>
<p>The sport, a modern day warfare, is repeated each fall and on each Saturday two regional foes are able to claim victory, for a day, and for a season.</p>
<p>The immediacy of outcome, the sense of participation, and the consequence of defeat has been transported from a battlefield to a playing field.</p>
<hr>
<p>No better guide than Spencer, for either a tour of historical sites or as commentator of sports events.</p>
<p>In many ways, he was better than the internet offerings or even Chat GPT.</p>
<p>Because he would tailor his narrative to fit the audience – of one.</p>
<p>In this era of confusion and division, our own <code>Warring States (Ideas) Period</code>, Spencer provided a clear, logical, calming narrative.</p>

<p>Goal 2: Miroslav Klose</p>
<p>Jokes about him being “the Kloser” abounds, but he finishes the best within 8 yards of the goal. Now, he has 16 goals to lead all World Cup scorers and passed Brazil’s Ronaldo. His goal came off of a turnover in Brazil’s defensive half, where Kroos salvaged a poor pass and saw Muller racing across the front of the goal. <img src="https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/Shot Clock Blog/klose-goal-turnover.webp" class="img-fluid"> One pinpoint pass later, the defenders and goalkeeper Julio Cesar crash on Muller, but Muller drops the pass to the feet of Klose.</p>
<p><img src="https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/Shot Clock Blog/klose-goal-shot-on-goal.png" class="img-fluid"> Klose shoots, Cesar makes the first save but leaves a juicy rebound for Klose to finish. 2-0 Germany. Congrats on your 16th goal, Klose!</p>

<li>Taysom Hill, BYU</li>
</ol>
<p>He is a dark horse for the Heisman trophy, according to some, but he is just as dangerous as Tim Tebow was at Florida. Before a season-ending and gruesome injury at Utah State, Hill wowed college football fans and scouts with his running style and numbers (although many project him as a running back-type player in the NFL if he chooses to play/is drafted:</p>
<p>I mean, he did run rampant in the 2013 game against Texas and even hurdled a defender on a touchdown run last year:</p>

<p>He’s coming back from tearing his knee, so no one is too sure if he’ll be the same. But, BYU’s independent schedule is intriguing and if they do well, it’ll be because of Taysom Hill. Everyone loves an underdog (see: Boise State).</p>

<p>The Lord will never lead us astray and He is always with us.</p>
<p>He has been with me during my trial and diagnosis of cancer.</p>

<p>I have heard from people whom I love and respect as a youth and as an adult.<br>
I have felt my Savior’s love.<br>
I know He is real.</p>

  <title>Harvest Gathering</title>
  <link>https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/Mid Autumn Festival/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>All cultures celebrate and give thanks during the harvest season.</p>
<p>The Wikipedia defines a Harvest Celebration as</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>A harvest festival is an annual celebration that occurs around the time of the main harvest of a given region</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For many in the northern Asia, the Harvest Festival is celebrated during the 8th Lunar Month, when the moon is full<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p><img src="https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/Mid Autumn Festival/roof_bw.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>For Koreans, of my generation, 추석(秋夕, Autumn Evening), or 한가위(the great middle (of autumn)) is a time of gathering, celebrating, remembering of ancestors.</p>
<p>The gathering is according to family units at the hometown for at least 3 days.</p>
<p>It is time of great feast, fresh harvest along with items normally set aside for special occasions.</p>
<p>It is a celebration if the harvest was sufficient to last the winter months, or when the next harvest can be expected – at least during the agrarian days.</p>
<p>Remembering the ancestors involves tidying up the grave and preparing a meal for the deceased and saying set phrases executing set movements.</p>
<hr>
<p>Normally, it is a time of anticipation and celebration, unless the person is one of over 8 million<sup>2</sup> 실향민 in South Korea.</p>
<p>실향민(失鄕民 / refugee), is also translated a <code>Displace People</code>. People who are unable to return to their homeland due to, usually, man-made, political boundaries.</p>
<p>Growing up, gathering during the Harvest Celebration, meant visiting the graves of the deceased and visiting the household with the oldest member of the clan.</p>
<p>Since my family migrated (or were refugees) from Northern part of Korea, the gathering was very small, the celebration was limited. We talked of old home (老家) and we yearned for the day when we can travel to the ancestral home and meet the people with common heritage.</p>
<p><img src="https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/Mid Autumn Festival/old_home.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>That dream is still is alive.</p>
<p>However the probability of its occurrence is small. Even it was possible, what is the meaning of face to face meeting people with no interactions or knowledge of relationship – for nearly 75 years.</p>
<hr>
<p>Celebrating harvest celebration alone as a grown up was more challenging. Everyone took the, mandatory time off and headed to their hometown.</p>
<p>I, on the other hand, went and visited my only relative in Seoul – traveling in opposite direction than the vast majority of the population.</p>
<p>Living in the United States has been a dream of my parents. Most of the time, I relish the label of refugee/immigrant. A refugee within Korea followed by migration to the great land of America.</p>
<p>At times, especially during the time of family gathering to ancestral home, I wish to know the rest of people that I ought to know.</p>
<hr>
<section id="importance-of-physical-gathering" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="importance-of-physical-gathering">Importance of Physical Gathering</h2>
<p>Biblical patriarchs speaks of gathering unto the people. Similar expression are used in Korea, including the phrase, <code>돌아가다</code>, return to where one originated from.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,<sup>3</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our physical, mortal existence ends with a burial - a literal and a symbolic gathering. In Christianity, that symbolic burial of the body is followed by the literal gathering of spirits and souls, it is called the resurrection.</p>

<p>Approaching the latter half of life, contemplating the eventual death and transformation, I begin to wonder and as I prepare,</p>

<li>Will we be gathered and organized by the family groups.</li>

<li>How will wrongs and lack of experiences due to premature death be corrected and extended.</li>
<li>What type of learning and how will furthering of our understanding happen</li>

<p>You are so young to be taken away from us so soon.</p>
<p>Our hearts ache, especially for Meg, on your sudden passing.</p>
<p>The aggressive and extremely rare form of pancreatic cancer you were diagnosed with less than a month ago was a huge curveball no one ever saw coming.</p>
<p>We feel extra sad that you never even had the chance to fight your disease, but relieved at the same time that you no longer will be in so much pain.</p>
<p>I first met you during rehearsal dinner the night before your wedding day to my niece on Thanksgiving weekend 2017.</p>
<p>After that, we’ve had a lot of good conversations and exchanges of opinions on different topics every time we meet on family gatherings since you became part of our clan.</p>
<p>You’re such an intelligent person and I enjoyed all our conversations.</p>
<p>And you have this habit of pushing the middle part of your eyeglasses up your nose bridge with your forefinger.</p>
<p>I have witnessed how you look after and took care of Meg that I remembered she even honored you with an award for best in husbandship category.</p>
<p>You are a great guy and a wonderful human being.</p>
<p>I relished all the conversations we had over the few years I’ve known you and the add-on comments you typically make that shone light on your being a history buff.</p>
<p>I still have the email you sent me in 2021 with detailed itineraries for my planned trip to the DC area.</p>
<p>I will make that trip and follow your guide in your honor.</p>
<p>My trip to AZ this coming weekend was long ago planned for Layla’s 1st birthday and I was looking forward to our usual board and trivia games.</p>
<p>Instead I’ll be seeing you this time at your funeral services.🥲</p>
<p>Thank you, Spence, for the time you have spent with us. Your time on this earth may have been short, but your wonderful memories will remain with us forever.</p>
<p>Our lives are extra special for having been blessed with your wonderful presence.</p>
<p>You will be so dearly missed.</p>
<p>Soar high, Spence. We love you.❤️</p>

<p>Yesterday, my brother-in-law Spencer (Meg’s husband), passed away.</p>
<p>He was battling an aggressive and extremely rare type of pancreatic cancer that has led to multiple organ failure.</p>
<p>He was 35 years young and we only found out about his diagnosis about a month ago.</p>
<p>His decline was SO rapid (he hasn’t started chemo) that all of us are in disbelief but we are so thankful for family and friends who were able to come at such short notice.</p>
<p>He passed away peacefully surrounded by family.</p>
<p>Meg’s strength amazes me.</p>
<p>She has stepped up and took great care of Spencer.</p>
<p>My baby sister loved her husband fiercely and this has been so heartbreaking for all us.</p>
<p>Love you, Spencer Irvine!</p>
<p>Thank you for being SO good to Meg and to all of us, for loving my kids and being who you are.</p>
<p>You are loved by so, so many! ❤️</p>

<p>Mine eyes have seen the glory Of the coming of the Lord; He is trampling out the vintage Where the grapes of wrath are stored; He hath loosed the fateful lightning Of His terrible swift sword; His truth is marching on.</p>
<p>Chorus</p>
<p><em>Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.</em></p>
<p>I have seen Him in the watchfires Of a hundred circling camps They have builded Him an altar In the evening dews and damps; I can read His righteous sentence By the dim and flaring lamps; His day is marching on.</p>
<p><em>Chorus Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.</em></p>
<p>He has sounded forth the trumpet That shall never call retreat; He is sifting out the hearts of men Before His judgement seat; Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; Be jubilant, my feet; Our God is marching on.</p>
<p><em>Chorus Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on</em>.</p>
<p>In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea, With a glory in His bosom That transfigures you and me; As He died to make men holy, Let us die to make men free; While God is marching on.</p>

<section id="kristy-irvine" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="kristy-irvine">Kristy Irvine</h2>
<p>My hope and prayer today is that the the spirit can be with me.</p>
<p>To help me get through this.</p>
<p>It took a long time for me to think about how I could give Spencer, a proper tribute to, who he was.</p>
<p>My dear brother Spencer left this mortality too soon, but not without making his mark in this world.</p>
<p>He lived his life in accordance with the principles that he knew to be true and aligned his life with the will of our savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I think that it can be said of him, that like Nephi</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I glory in plainness,<br>
I glory in truth, I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spencer loved the Gospel of Jesus Christ and embodied it, and in all that he did. Even as a child, he could recognize true principles and devoted his life to the savior and our Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>He was a black and white kind of guy. He could see right. And he knew when things were wrong.</p>
<p>One of my favorite things that we talked about this week was, that even in preschool, when he was interviewed for a new story about missing school, he told the reporter that he missed school because he wanted to play.</p>
<p>And those were facts.</p>
<p>There’s a small section of a talk given by Michelle Craig that I would like to read because we can insert Spencer’s name into it and see him in it, she says.</p>
<hr>
<p>“When hard times come, I try to remember that I chose to follow Christ before I came to Earth and that challenges to my faith, my health and my endurance are all part of the reason I’m here.</p>
<p>And I certainly should never think that today’s trial calls into question God’s love for me or let it turn my faith in him into doubt.</p>
<p>Trials do not mean that the plan is failing.</p>
<p>They are part of the plan, meant to help me seek God.</p>
<p>I become more like him when I endure patiently and hopefully like him when in agony.</p>
<p>I pray more earnestly.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ was the perfect example of loving our father with all his heart, of doing his will and regardless of the cost, I want to follow his his example by doing the same”</p>
<hr>
<p>Spencer embodied so many Christ-like attributes throughout his short time here on Earth.</p>
<p>He was full of faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>He fully accepted him as his personal Savior and Redeemer, and looked to Him in all things.</p>
<p>In <code>Preach My Gospel</code>, which is a guide for all members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p>It says that faith leads to action, and when you have faith in Jesus Christ, you accomplish what the Lord wants you to accomplish. And you help bring about good in your own life and the lives of others.</p>
<p>Spencer was always doing good in his life. He served others.</p>
<p>He remembered birthdays. He apologized for not remembering birthdays.</p>
<p>And he was always one to help when needed. Spencer was full of hope. He hoped for a better future for himself and Meg, and always look forward, not back.</p>
<p>He was patient, optimistic and persevered through his multiple surgeries, injuries, his recent diagnosis.</p>
<p>And in every trial that he faced, his eye was fixed firmly upon the Savior.</p>
<p>President James E Faust taught, <code>hope is the anchor of our souls</code>.</p>
<p>Spencer lived his life full of hope.</p>
<p>A man once asked Jesus which is the great commandment in the law.</p>
<p>Jesus replied,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment, and the second is like unto it. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spencer did this his entire life.</p>
<p>He put the Lord first.</p>
<p>His friends knew what he stood for and what he wouldn’t say or do.</p>
<p>Spencer listened to those around him and loved them unconditionally.</p>
<p>He served a full time mission in California, and his letters were always full of love for those around him.</p>
<p>Whenever I would text Spencer, he was quick to offer a kind word.</p>
<p>He supported me with love and was slow to anger.</p>
<p>His life was a life of charity, the pure love of Christ was part of who he was.</p>
<p>Spencer was a true disciple of Christ.</p>
<p>Elder De Feo. said in a talk entitled <code>Pure Love</code>, the true sign of every disciple of Jesus Christ said<sup>4</sup>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>True disciples love to submit themselves to the Lord with peace in their heart. They are humble and submissive because they love him. They have faith to fully accept his will, not only in what he does, but also in how and when.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>True disciples know that the real blessings are not always what they want, but rather what the Lord wants for them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His humility and willingness to submit to the will of The Lord was and is inspiring.</p>
<p>Spencer went through periods of unemployment which to us is very disappointing and many when faced with this challenge can become despondent and even quick to anger with the Lord for not helping answer prayers for good employment.</p>
<p>Spencer did everything that he could to provide for himself and Meg, even taking jobs that were not equal to his education or talents.</p>
<p>But they were jobs that would allow him to provide. His humility and submission to the Lord, yielded great results with a job that Spencer truly loved.</p>
<p>Elder De Feo also said <code>pure love is the true sign of every true disciple of Jesus Christ</code>.</p>
<p>I’m sure many of you have memories of Spencer embodying this statement. His love was pure, it was unfettered from judgment and hostility.</p>
<p>He was a happy person who loved unconditionally.</p>
<p>He laughed with so many, he welcomed all.</p>
<p>He threw himself into youth activities and was always the first to offer a smile, tell a good joke and ask if anyone needed help.</p>
<p>Spencer loved his family.</p>
<p>He devoted his time to his sweetheart, Meg, and gave her everything that he could offer and the circumstances that they lived in.</p>
<p>He loved everything about his nieces and nephews.</p>
<p>And would gush over their photos and celebrate their accomplishments and encourage them when I would tell him of a struggle in their life.</p>
<p>In closing, I want to share a few thoughts on the resurrection. As we look to that day with longing and hope of seeing our dear Spencer again</p>
<p>The following is taken from a talk called <code>Sunday Will Come</code>, by Elder Wirthlin<sup>5</sup>.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>President Joseph F. Smith said “that those from whom we have to part here, we will meet again and see as they are. We will meet the same identical being that we associated with here in the flesh.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>President Spencer W. Kimball amplified this when he said, “I am sure that if we can imagine ourselves at our very best, physically, mentally, spiritually, that is the way we will come back.”</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>“When Christ rose from the grave, becoming the first fruits of the Resurrection, He made that gift available to all. And with that sublime act, He softened the devastating, consuming sorrow that gnaws at the souls of those who have lost precious loved ones.</p>
<p>I think of how dark that Friday was when Christ was lifted up on the cross.</p>
<p>On that terrible Friday the earth shook and grew dark. Frightful storms lashed at the earth.</p>
<p>Those evil men who sought His life rejoiced. Now that Jesus was no more, surely those who followed Him would disperse. On that day they stood triumphant.</p>
<p>On that day the veil of the temple was rent in twain.</p>
<p>Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Jesus, were both overcome with grief and despair. The superb man they had loved and honored hung lifeless upon the cross.</p>
<p>On that Friday the Apostles were devastated. Jesus, their Savior—the man who had walked on water and raised the dead—was Himself at the mercy of wicked men. They watched helplessly as He was overcome by His enemies.</p>
<p>On that Friday the Savior of mankind was humiliated and bruised, abused and reviled.</p>
<p>It was a Friday filled with devastating, consuming sorrow that gnawed at the souls of those who loved and honored the Son of God.</p>
<p>I think that of all the days since the beginning of this world’s history, that Friday was the darkest.</p>
<p>But the doom of that day did not endure.</p>
<p>The despair did not linger because on Sunday, the resurrected Lord burst the bonds of death. He ascended from the grave and appeared gloriously triumphant as the Savior of all mankind.</p>
<p>And in an instant the eyes that had been filled with ever-flowing tears dried. The lips that had whispered prayers of distress and grief now filled the air with wondrous praise, for Jesus the Christ, the Son of the living God, stood before them as the first fruits of the Resurrection, the proof that death is merely the beginning of a new and wondrous existence.</p>
<p>Each of us will have our own Fridays—those days when the universe itself seems shattered and the shards of our world lie littered about us in pieces. We all will experience those broken times when it seems we can never be put together again. We will all have our Fridays.</p>
<p>But I testify to you in the name of the One who conquered death—Sunday will come. In the darkness of our sorrow, Sunday will come.</p>
<p>No matter our desperation, no matter our grief, Sunday will come. In this life or the next, Sunday will come.</p>
<p>I testify to you that the Resurrection is not a fable. We have the personal testimonies of those who saw Him. Thousands in the Old and New Worlds witnessed the risen Savior. They felt the wounds in His hands, feet, and side. They shed tears of unrestrained joy as they embraced Him.</p>
<p>After the Resurrection, the disciples became renewed. They traveled throughout the world proclaiming the glorious news of the gospel.</p>
<p>Had they chosen, they could have disappeared and returned to their former lives and occupations. In time, their association with Him would have been forgotten.</p>
<p>They could have denied the divinity of Christ. Yet they did not. In the face of danger, ridicule, and threat of death, they entered palaces, temples, and synagogues boldly proclaiming Jesus the Christ, the resurrected Son of the living God.</p>
<p>Many of them offered as a final testimony their own precious lives. They died as martyrs, the testimony of the risen Christ on their lips as they perished.</p>
<hr>
<p>My hope is that as Spencer passed through the veil, he could he could hear the words of Paul in his mind.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The time in my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>May we all remember our dear friend Spencer and the compass that he used to guide his life, the Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>May we take the example that Spencer set for us and following the Savior that we may invite the Savior more fully into our lives and willingly give our shortcomings to him that he may help us be perfect in Him.</p>
<p>My testimony is that Sunday will come that glorious day when we will be reunited with those we love and rejoice in the great gift that the Savior has given us through his sacrifice in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="steven-irvine">Steven Irvine</h2>
<p>Spencer was a special person.</p>
<p>As you heard from Kristy, he was the most Christ like.</p>
<p>Kind, caring, loving person that I know.</p>
<p>He was the best older brother. He was the best friend. And the best example, that I could have.</p>
<p>This week has been a week of reflection for me</p>
<p>I tried to figure out and appreciate how much my life was influenced by my older brother and the 31 years that I was able to spend with him.</p>
<p>I realized I attribute so much of who I am to who he was And how much I wanted to be like him.</p>
<p>Growing up, I shared a room with him and we always talked before going to bed in our little bunk beds.</p>
<p>All of my hobbies, all of my knowledge came from his influence. And because he loved history and civil war, so I know about Antietam and Gettysburg Because he was so obsessed with those things and we’d go on these trips over to Virginia and have fun as a family.</p>
<p>Because that’s what Spencer loved. I just wanted to be there with him and I wanted to learn about these that he loved.</p>
<p>My love for all sports comes from his nerdiness.</p>
<p>All thosee stats that he knew and I’m going to miss texting</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>hey, what do you think about this guy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he would text me back all these stats.</p>
<p>That’s just who he was.</p>
<p>He was so loving and knowledgeable. He just gave everything his all, I always wanted to follow in his footsteps.</p>
<p>I wanted to be the college football fan that could talk football with my brother. I wanted to play the video games, growing up with my brother and my sister, and have fun playing Mario Kart with them.</p>
<p>I just wanted to be him.</p>
<p>That’s what what I’ve realized over this last week. I really wanted to be my brother.</p>
<p>Because he just set such a good example for me.</p>
<p>How to be man How to be an adult. How to be a spouse.</p>
<p>Because he adored Meg and he treated her like a queen. And I thought to myself one day I want to love somebody like that because I saw how much he loved her.</p>
<p>He was everything I could ask for from an older brother. He was truly the best example. He had the best laugh, even though it was a little too loud.</p>
<p>We all loved it.</p>
<p>You can read all the hundreds of Facebook comments about him and his contagious laughter, with his big smile and how it just came out of his chest.</p>
<p>And you knew exactly where he was at all times.</p>
<p>He had so much fun with everything that he did and he just loved life so much.</p>
<p>And there’s a word that I was thinking of. How do I how do I explain who Spencer was? To somebody who didn’t know my older brother.</p>
<p>The word is <code>Vigor</code>. And that’s just how Spencer lived.</p>
<p>He lived with so much vigor, he loved life, he loved everybody.</p>
<p>He was everybody’s best friend. He talked to people on the airplane. Who does that? But that was Spencer.</p>
<p>He was everybody’s best friend. He always had a smile on his face.</p>
<p>If you look at any of those pictures, you knew he was a happy person. And he was so Christ like.</p>
<p>He was so loving. He was so caring. And it’s just as my sister said. He leaves such a big hole in our family.</p>
<p>And now, as I try to compare myself to him,</p>
<p>He would call my parents out of the blue to check up on them.</p>
<p>I call my parents to get something from them, or ask them a question. But Spencer cared about how my dad’s day was going. While I was like,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>oh, I could call my dad today, I guess, but…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He just he loved them so much and he was just such a good son.</p>
<p>He was my dad’s best friend. He always thought about them. He always thought about other people, even when he was sick last Wednesday.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, he called me – four times. I thought this was strange.</p>
<p>I was working and I missed the calls. I thought it was weird that he called me four times and he left me a voicemail.</p>
<p>And the voicemail starts off with.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Love you little bro. Thank you so much for praying for us and all the support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then he ends it with</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>love you so much. Take care, Steven.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I didn’t at the time, I didn’t think much of it Because well, we will have time with him. But, why did he call me? On a Wednesday during a work day.</p>
<p>Why did he feel like he had to call me so many times and I ended up calling him back and we had a really great chat for 45 minutes.</p>
<p>That was the last time I spoke to him.</p>
<p>But he knew somehow that he needed to leave me this message that I’m going to cherish for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>He knew that he needed to call me then because he wasn’t going to have an opportunity again.</p>
<p>He knew that he just needed to talk to me. Somehow some way Spencer knew.</p>
<p>Despite feeling low, despite being bloated and having pain and being on painkillers. Knowing that there was a very grim prognosis for him, he called me in the middle of the week, last Wednesday.</p>
<p>To tell me that he loved me.</p>
<p>Because that’s just who he was.</p>
<p>I couldn’t imagine my life without him.</p>
<p>No matter what I did, he was always the prouder, older brother.</p>
<p>Even when he was unemployed and struggling and really challenged. I got a job and I started moving up the ladder and he was always so proud of me.</p>
<p>And looking back</p>
<p>If I were in his shoes, I’d be thinking,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>what a little punk. Why does he get a job. How is he doing this and I’m not? I have the master’s degree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There would be so many things going through my mind of how I would have reacted to these negative situations.</p>
<p>But Spencer didn’t.</p>
<p>Every time I texted him, he was always so proud of me. He was always so happy for me.</p>
<p>I don’t know how I would have reacted to all that. I don’t know how I would have been non judgmental. Or not angry? At all of these circumstances that happened to me.</p>
<p>But no matter what, he was just such a trooper. He was always so positive in the middle of all. Whether his diagnosis or Doctor visits, he would call me and tell me.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You know what? I’m going to beat this thing. I’m going to stay positive. I’m going to do it. And we’re going to beat it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He had so much hope. And so much love.</p>
<p>I remember one of the last things he told me on that Wednesday.</p>
<p>How amazing our family has been for him. How much support his friends and family have given him all across the world. How amazing his wife was for doing everything for him, taking him to the ER all those times and bearing that burden with him.</p>
<p>As I look throughout the years and I think of how amazing of an older brother he was.</p>
<p>Every situation that I would have reacted negatively, he reacted positively.</p>
<p>Every person that he met, he left with a good impression When I probably would have been judgmental.</p>
<p>He was a better man.</p>
<p>He was so positive. So Christ like So loving.</p>
<p>He set a good example for me, despite everything that he faced. He was always encouraging me, always trying to teach me and be the supportive older brother that he knew that he needed to be.</p>
<p>And last Saturday, before we came down to Arizona on Sunday, for the first time in years, I watched college football in our basement.</p>
<p>I said to myself,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Wow, this would be really fun if Spencer gets his chemo treatment and he feels good enough, one day I’ll fly him up here so we can have another college football Saturday that we used to have growing up.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I felt a little bit of Spencer next to me. Looking back at it, it feels very surreal that I almost felt like I had him with me. For that one day, the day before he passed, I decided to watch college football. That I decided to do that one thing that he loves so much doing with me.</p>
<p>And I felt him and that a little part of him was there with me I will cherish that moment for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>I love my brother so much.</p>
<p>He’s such a good example to me. He was the most Christlike person that I know. And I will miss him dearly.</p>
<p>And I want to close this with my testimony. I know that I’m going to see him again. And I can’t wait to see him and get one of those big bear hugs that he always gives.</p>
<p>Because I’m already missing those.</p>
<p>I know that he’s watching over us. And I know that the plan of salvation is real and I can’t wait to see him again.</p>
<p>I say that in the name of Jesus Christ.</p>

<section id="alfredo-lopez" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="alfredo-lopez">Alfredo Lopez</h2>
<p>Good morning. My name is Alfredo and like all of you, I had the privilege of calling Spencer, my friend.</p>
<p>I want to give a tribute to Spencer and tell you all the amazing adventures that we went on.</p>
<p>I really don’t remember my life Without Spencer.</p>
<p>When my family moved to the United States from Lima, Peru. Spencer was literally one of my first friends.</p>
<p>So I literally don’t remember much at all the adventures we’ve been on while Spencer being there with me, - or me calling him, - or reaching out to him, - or sending him pictures, - or him sending me pictures back, - or something awesome that we were doing.</p>
<hr>
<p>We we went to middle school together. We went to Argon Middle school. And we have a social studies class together.</p>
<p>And I was still learning English. And island is spelled ISLAND, right?</p>
<p>The S is silent. So you say island. And I was in the class and I said Iceland because I pronounce the S because in Spanish you pronounce all the letters.</p>
<p>Spencer was like.</p>
<p>No, no, don’t say it like that,</p>
<p>I’m like, why not? Are you sure that doesn’t sound right?</p>
<p>But and then I told the teacher, I asked her about the Iceland. And she said, we’re talking about Islands</p>
<p>I was like, Oh.</p>
<p>That was my relationship with Spencer.</p>
<hr>
<p>I called Spencer my personal political adviser.</p>
<p>Whenever I needed something or I needed to know something.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What’s going on?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I always call Spencer or text him.</p>
<p>I’ll say,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Hey Spencer. What is going on with this cause? He already knew about it, had done all the research on it and so he gave me all the information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He gave me the Cliff notes as well. And it was amazing.</p>
<p>Spencer was also my mentor – always.</p>
<hr>
<p>I was conflicted whether or not to wear my service uniform today. But I’m wearing it, to honor Spencer.</p>
<p>10 years ago I enlist in the Marine Corps. I now serve in the army. When I was going through the process of which branch to join, who do you think I was calling?</p>
<p>I was calling Spencer. Because he knew all about the branches and what was going on with each one of them.</p>
<p>So when I went to see the Air Force recruiters, right after that, I called Spencer.</p>
<p>When I went to see the Navy recruiters, then I called Spencer.</p>
<p>But not with the Army recruitors, since I didn’t want anything to do with the army.</p>
<p>But here I am.</p>
<p>And then, I went to see the Marines recruiters, and I called Spencer.</p>
<p>He was like,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>yeah, you should do that one I think would be great.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it was terrible. It really was.</p>
<p>The training was horrible.</p>
<p>But I stuck through it. And when I graduated, the recruit training in San Diego. I called Spencer.</p>
<p>I said, hey, man, I did it because of you</p>
<hr>
<p>Spencer and I, we grew up in what I now I’m calling <code>The Fabulous 5</code>.</p>
<p>Our fearless leader, our Captain Moroni, was Spencer.</p>
<p>He was our righteous leader.</p>
<p>From the moment we were deacons, he was a deacons president. And we knew that we had to follow Spencer because he was always ready to do the right thing no matter what it was. And he motivated us all to do it.</p>
<p>Part of this gang was also Danny B., Michael S., Brandon R. and myself. Now the five of us we grew up together since we were 12, all he way to our missions and then we moved on with our lives</p>
<p>But during these formative years and our teenage years, looking back, Spencer was our rock.</p>
<p>He was so diligent, so smart.</p>
<p>I was talking to Michael and he told me that he wanted to be a student like Spencer.</p>
<p>So he started meet up with Spencer to do his homework together because Spencer was a very serious student.</p>
<p>One thing about Spencer was his dilligence, he was amazing, I admire him for that.</p>
<p>But then Michael started to kind of corrupt Spencer.</p>
<p>He would say,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>hey, Spencer instead of doing homework, what if we played on the Xbox. Let’s go play some Battlefront</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Spencer would respond,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>No, we gotta do homework, man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Spencer was so nice, so he would crack down a few times. But then he was like, no, this isn’t right.</p>
<p>We’re not doing this.</p>
<hr>
<p>Spencer wasa really kind person and absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>But on the sports field he had no mercy.</p>
<p>I hated to play against him any sport, whether it was soccer, football, basketball.</p>
<p>Because as sweet as Spencer is.</p>
<p>Oh my goodness. On the sports field he became a warrior.</p>
<p>I ran so fast as to not get tackled by him.</p>
<p>For every Turkey Bowl, I always make sure I was on Spencer team. Because I didn’t want him chasing me down.</p>
<p>And it was awesome to see when he joined the high school football team. He loved it and it was great.</p>
<p>And I was so glad he was there because he was so tough.</p>
<p>I like to consider myself tough, but no Spencer is tough, so much tougher than me.</p>
<hr>
<p>Then Spencer served mission in California and he learned that language <code>de los ceielos</code></p>
<p>The tongue of the heavens.</p>
<p>And when he came back and we met up after our missions.</p>
<p>It was a brand new world of our friendship, because now I still got Spencer, but we could also talk to the senoritas.</p>
<p>I would say,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>let’s go down some machaca and salsa,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Spencer was always down.</p>
<p>He was like,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>OK, let’s go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, Spencer, we’re gonna be coming home at 6:00 in the morning.</p>
<p>He would say,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Alright, let’s do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You know, we took care of each other.</p>
<hr>
<p>It was so beautiful to see how he now could communicate with my parents in a whole different way.</p>
<p>Growing up with Spencer and the Irvines, they were our families as well.</p>
<p>And Spencer was so excited, I could see that excitement in his face when he first talked to my mom in Spanish.</p>
<p>And his Spanish was amazing. You know, it was LA Spanish, which, we forgave him for that. But it was still amazing.</p>
<p>And he would come and ask my mom for the recipes for Arroz con pollo and Huancaina, which are some Peruvian dishes, and he loved them.</p>
<p>Spencer was always at the weddings of my family He was there when my sister got married. Also when I got married.</p>
<p>It was just awesome.</p>
<p>Because Spencer was my rock. He was also full of love. And so humble.</p>
<hr>
<p>This was during one of our many, many camping trips with the scouts.</p>
<p>For some reason I didn’t have any warm gear and I was freezing.</p>
<p>Spencer noticed that</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Hey man, here, take my coat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was like,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>no, no, you’re gonna need it because it was really cold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think we were in mountains in western Maryland, Sugarloaf Mountains, and we spent all night trading the coat because I was freezing and he was freezing</p>
<p>But you know, we got some sleep.</p>
<p>He took care of me and I tried to take care of him.</p>
<p>Since then, we grew into our 30s and moved on with our lives.</p>
<p>I would, from time to time, would still check in with Spencer.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the fall of 2021, I got assigned to be deployed to Eastern Europe for a year.</p>
<p>It said on my assignment, Kosovo and I was like, where is that?</p>
<p>So I made three phone calls.</p>
<p>The first one was my wife,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I’m getting deployed. I’m leaving for a little bit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then my parents, to let them know.</p>
<p>Then Spencer, I was like,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Spencer, what do you know about this place?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and he already knew all about it.</p>
<p>And I was like,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Amazing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was my Intel guy to the Intel officer.</p>
<p>It was awesome, and even when I was gone, I would ask,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>hey, Spencer, what’s going on here</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He would respond,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>let me. Look up. I’ll get back to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now, I don’t have that Intel guy anymore.</p>
<p>For now.</p>
<p>Because I know I will see him again.</p>
<hr>
<p>Last Friday, my brother texted me and said,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>hey, I think Spencer is sick.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I said,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>oh, let me hit him up, see what’s going on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So last Saturday I called him.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Hey, Spencer, I heard you aren’t feeling well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he filled me in</p>
<p>And I told Spencer.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>You have to beat this thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because he had to meet my son, Levi Lopez. He was born 3 weeks ago.</p>
<p>Spencer said,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>YES ~ I’m going to do this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As Kristy and Steven said, Spencer was extremely positive.</p>
<p>The most positive person I’ve met.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>’Cause I’m gonna beat this thing and overcome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I said, perfect.</p>
<p>When you come back out to Maryland, I’m gonna kidnap you. Gonna go down to Virginia. We’re gonna hang out in the Potomac.</p>
<p>It’s gonna be amazing.</p>
<p>He will meet my children. And we will go… We will go on many more adventures.</p>
<p>Because that is what the gospel is all about.</p>
<p>It’s eternal relationships.</p>
<hr>
<p>Friends are like seasons.</p>
<p>Some come and go, but not Spencer.</p>
<p>He was my rock.</p>
<p>This restored gospel is True. And I love it with all my heart. My testimony was stronger.</p>
<p>Because of Spencer.</p>
<hr>
<p>I remember the joy in his face when he opened his mission call.</p>
<p>He was going to learn Spanish, he was so pumped about that.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing my friend again. He is my brother.</p>
<p>Because I know I will because Christ came to the earth and he atoned for our sins. And He knew that Spencer was a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>He never wavered. He was one of the best examples for me.</p>
<hr>
<p>I called my dad and asked him how I should organized some of my thoughts today.</p>
<p>He replied with this.</p>
<p>You can cry because he’s gone. Or</p>
<p>You can smile because of the amazing life that he lived.</p>
<p>You can close your eyes and pray that he will come back right now. Or</p>
<p>You could open your eyes and look at everything that he did that he left behind.</p>
<p>Your heart is void because he’s not here anymore. Or it could be full of joy because the good times you had with him.</p>
<p>You could cry. You could close your mind and feel the emptiness and turn around.</p>
<p>Or you could do what he would have wanted you to do.</p>
<p>Which is to smile. Open your eyes and love. And endure to the end.</p>
<hr>
<p>And so that’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to smile and honor my friend.</p>
<p>And remember all the great times we had.</p>
<p>I’m going to love. I’m going to talk to people on airplanes.</p>
<p>I’m going to be more attentive.</p>
<p>I’m going to love deeply.</p>
<p>Because that’s what Spencer did. That is what I’m going to do — `till the end.</p>
<p>Because the only explanation that I have is this, that Heavenly Father needed Spencer. By His side.</p>
<p>Because that is how amazing he is. So I have to get there too</p>
<p>I have to live this gospel and under the eternal covenants that we have with Heavenly Father.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m so grateful to have the privilege to have spent my life with him. And for him to be my friend and my brother.</p>
<p>My family loves me so deeply.</p>
<p>Every single one of my siblings. There are six of us in total. We all have unique experiences with Spencer.</p>
<p>We all love him so much.</p>
<p>There isn’t a picture from our teenage years that are without Spencer in it.</p>
<p>I know that this gospel is true. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is the only true church on this earth.</p>
<p>Spencer knew it too.</p>
<p>And he shared that message with everyone he met in California.</p>
<p>That was his mission.</p>
<p>And so thankful for all of you, and for your support.</p>
<p>And I say all these things. In the name of our savior, Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bishop-mccormack-2">Bishop McCormack</h2>
<p>Two favorite songs that all primary children sing.</p>
<p><code>I'm a child of God</code> and <code>Families Can Be Together Forever</code>.</p>
<p>Two basic truths of the gospel.</p>
<p>Thank you to all family and friends for their beautiful messages and music this morning.</p>
<p>The Spirit was felt here in this Chapel.</p>
<p>If I can ask you to please take your hymnal out and turn to the hymn #86 that we sang this morning. (See Section&nbsp;0.2)</p>
<p>This hymn was not written by Emma Smith or one of the members of the past as the majority of songs in this book were.</p>
<p>We adopted this hymn because it brings to the focus, the fundamental plan of happiness, the main theme in the Book of Mormon.</p>
<p>In the first verse, the prominent section gives God, the glory for creating a world where we could come to gain the experience we need to grow up.</p>
<p>We need to grow up to be like our Heavenly Father.</p>
<p>Please turn your attention to the next verse, which brings us to the experience. the wonders of this earth. And the joy within</p>
<p>In Galatians 5:22 and 23 , it reads.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s what Spencer represented.</p>
<p>We are here to be happy.</p>
<p>Joseph Smith said.</p>
<p>It is the the design of our existence.</p>
<p>Now, as with all things, there needs to be an opposite. If not, we could not grow or have the agency to choose and make decisions for ourselves without depending on others to make them for us.</p>
<p>To be forced without agency is evil, and this is what the adversary wants. And since we are imperfect and expected to be imperfect, our Father’s Plan is to send His Son, His only begotten to redeem us from our imperfection, or save us from our mistakes.</p>
<p>In the third verse is the one that tears at me. It’s the one that when I ponder it, there’s something. There’s someone who loves me so much that would sacrifice Himself to go through such terrible experiences in the Garden of Gethsemane so that he can know my experiences of pain.</p>
<p>Through this act, in which no one understands how it works. He knows what we feel when someone we love without any fault of their own departs from this earth.</p>
<p>As the verse says. <code>I scarce can take it in</code>.</p>
<p>However, brothers and sisters, there’s hope. Meaning, whether we believe it or not, there comes a time when the Savior will return to embrace and congratulate us.</p>
<p>For, as we say in our faith, endure to the end.</p>
<p><code>Then I shall bow in humble adoration</code>. <code>And there proclaim my God</code>. <code>How great thou art</code>.</p>
<p>In 2 Nephi 4, Lehi blesses his posterity and passes away.</p>
<p>In reading Nephi’s words, Nephi seem initially and understandably, to have a difficult time with his father’s passing.</p>
<p>In verse 13, Nephi stated that his brothers, Laman and Lemuel were angry with him.</p>
<p>Can you imagine the scenario of all the trials that Nephi had gone through because of his brothers?</p>
<p>And then on top of all of that, the Lord said,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Don’t Nephi. You are not allowed to say anymore to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the next few verses, Nephi remembers all that the Lord has done for him.</p>
<p>He remembers this because there was a choice he had to make.</p>
<p>He’s been through many afflictions and remember he’s grieving or mourning his father’s death.</p>
<p>This is what he said in verse 27.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>And why should I yield to sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why should I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in my heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry because of mine enemy?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He’s Speaking of Laman and Lemuel.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Awake, my soul! No longer droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Do not anger again because of mine enemies. Do not slacken my strength because of mine afflictions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I ask you to please read the last five verses of the end of Nephi Chapter 4. Nephi pulls himself together and teaches us how to turn to the Lord to help in times of affliction.</p>
<p>These verses are very personal to him. And if you think of how he’s feeling when he writes these verses. There’s a parallel here with Nephi.</p>
<p>During a very vulnerable time for him after losing his father. And with all of us grieving the loss of Spencer.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Nephi’s personal struggle and passion is more apparent in these verses than in any other of his writings.</p>
<p>In verse 30, it begins with this with this prayer and pleas. I ask you to put yourself in his place. And repeat this prayer in your mind. And Nephi asks that you pray unto the Lord in this manner.</p>
<p>In verse 30.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>O Lord, I will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee, my God, and the rock of my salvation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>O Lord, wilt thou redeem my soul? Wilt thou deliver me out of the hands of mine enemies? Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the appearance of sin?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He continues, in verse 33</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>O Lord, wilt thou encircle me around in the robe of thy righteousness! O Lord, wilt thou make a way for mine escape before mine enemies! Wilt thou make my path straight before me! Wilt thou not place a stumbling block in my way—but that thou wouldst clear my way before me, and hedge not up my way, but the ways of mine enemy.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh; for I know that cursed is he that putteth his trust in the arm of flesh. Yea, cursed is he that putteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. Yea, my God will give me, if I bask cnot amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the drock of my erighteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to bear in my testimony that I know God lives. He loves us. He sent his Son to redeem us.</p>
<p>I know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God And he translated the Book of Mormon by the power of God.</p>
<p>I know that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the church here on this earth today</p>
<p>And I know that this church is led by a prophet, a living prophet, who receives revelation</p>
<p>Thank you all for being here.</p>
<p>Meg, We love you.</p>
<p>We love your family. Although for a short time, I know that they love you. You have such great support. And it goes without saying that Spencer was such a great guy.</p>
<p>I leave you with a blessing that you will always stay close to the gospel. He’s smiling down and up on us right now.</p>
<p>I know who he is.</p>
<p>And I say these things, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.</p>

<p>I’ll always treasure Spencer’s friendship and all the incredible times we had in college as roommates.&nbsp; He will be missed and we are praying for you!&nbsp; Love you guys!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Photos and Memories of Spencer taken by his roommates, <code>Mark Nielsen</code>, <code>Kameron Welsch</code>, and <code>Jacob Molnar</code>.</p>

<p>Below are some of Mark’s memories of Spencer when they lived together in the Marin Apartments in South Provo from August 2010 thru April 2011.</p>
<section id="memories-of-spencer" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="memories-of-spencer">Memories of Spencer</h2>
<p>I can’t remember how many times I came back to the apartment feeling tense or stressed because of school or work, but Spencer knew just how to get me laughing which broke the tension I was feeling.</p>
<p>When things were getting more serious between Michelle and I, Michelle asked for some time to consider the next step in our relationship…</p>
<p>That was the longest day and a half in my life!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spencer, realizing that something was up,asked how things were.&nbsp; He never pressured me to share details of what was going on, but just listened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I asked him for a blessing and he gave me a wonderful blessing that brought me comfort and peace.&nbsp; That’s when I realized what a true friend Spencer was to me.</p>
<p>Shortly after this, Spencer helped me set up a scavenger hunt for me to be able to propose to Michelle.&nbsp; He sat next to the BYU duck pond, waiting for Michelle to covertly make an “exchange” of briefcases as he read a newspaper.&nbsp; Then he rushed multiple additional clues to significant locations for Michelle and I.&nbsp; He was an incredible friend and sacrificed so much!</p>
<p>While on multiple trips to do some work training in the Maryland/DC.&nbsp; Spencer was excited and always willing to meet up at Chili’s or Buffalo Wild Wings to just hang out and chat.&nbsp; Was so nice to see a friendly face so far away from home!</p>
<p>On Halloween, Spencer dressed up as a mime and despite our many efforts to get him to break character and talk, he never did once… although we did get him to laugh once or twice.</p>

<p>I am ENGAGED!&nbsp; So… first I met Michell at her place. I had given her four gifts, each with… a clue.&nbsp; She figured it out and the place to go was my apartment. Then the scavenger hunt started… Spencer Irvine helped me by giving her the “mission, if she chose to accept it”, by being at “drop points” and taking stuff where I needed it…</p>

<p>Spencer Irvine was incredibly sweet, kind, smart and funny.</p>
<p>We spent 3 years together in early morning seminary and he was still all of those things at 6am!</p>
<p>I can still hear his great laugh and I will never forget him as Mr.&nbsp;Mumbles in the road show!</p>
<p>Sending all my love and prayers to the Irvine family during this time.</p>

<p>Spencer thank you for being such a great friend. I remember how kind you were to me and my mom when we first moved into Derwood Ward. All the great times we spent at camp outs, youth activities and just hanging out together as friends. You will be missed my Brother. May you rest in peace in Heaven.</p>

  <title>Our Spencer</title>
  <link>https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/20230925 SRI Personal/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>Our beloved husband, son, brother, and uncle Spencer Reed Irvine, passed away peacefully on the evening of 24 September 2023 in Scottsdale, Arizona after a courageous bout with cancer.</p>
<p>Spencer was born on February 13, 1988 in Rockville, Maryland.</p>
<p>He excelled in all areas of endeavors in life, yet he was humble and a friend to all.<br>
He embodied a gentle kindness to all and was a source of many excellent conversations.</p>
<p>He graduated from Brigham Young University, with an International Relations degree.<br>
He obtained a Master of Public Administration from George Washington University.<br>
He served in the California San Fernando Mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p><img src="https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/20230925 SRI Personal/temple_cloud.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>His hobbies and enjoyment included history, sport analytics, writing in areas of policies and politics, these shaped his life.</p>
<p>His talent for writing came from an accurate assessment of himself, grounded in his faith in Jesus Christ, and his surroundings.</p>
<p>Often drawing and building upon an initial assessment then rigorously testing his thesis and rewriting as many times as necessary to satisfy his high standard.</p>
<p>Perhaps he gained this skill through his father, Don, and also his grandfather Reed.<br>
Both of whom adored Spencer and influenced his outlook and shaped his core.</p>
<p>From his mother, Young Kang Irvine, Spencer learned hard work and perseverance – a first generation Korean immigrant.</p>
<p>Spencer had great interest in the service of Grandpa Kang in the Korean War and had researched into the battles that Grandpa was involved in.</p>
<p>Whether the setting was academic, religion, or work, Spencer applied all his faculties and energy.</p>
<p>And most responded because they all felt his sincerity and love, which Spencer was blessed with in abundance.</p>
<p><img src="https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/20230925 SRI Personal/tree_love.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Many select and establish their North Star and an internal compass, and means to reckon and keep track of passage of time to guide their journey in this life.</p>
<p>Spencer was gifted with an absolute and abiding True North and built himself a never deviating compass, and fashioned a perpetual time keeping method – all based on his faith in Jesus Christ, an understanding of the Will of the Father, and immense love for his fellow travelers.</p>
<p>He knew the purpose of this life, to love others as they need to be loved, without pre-condition or judgment.</p>
<p>Forever grateful that we got to know him and feel his love, taking a part in this journey together.</p>
<p>We have lost a guide, and the pain persists.</p>
<p>He was a leader that showed how to comfort and heal one another.</p>
<p>Spencer is survived by his love of life Meg Nuñez Irvine, loving parents Don and Young, siblings Kristy (Tyler) and Steven (Bree).</p>
<p>The funeral services will be held on Saturday, September 30, 2023, 10AM.<br>
(Viewing will be from 9AM to 9:45AM)</p>
<p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at 3920 N 44th Pl, Phoenix, AZ 85018. <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/EuyryWaA3nHQc2X29">Church Location</a></p>

  <title>A Weekend with Spencer</title>

<p>My sister in Mesa said,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Irvines are flying in, you should come down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When someone in AZ invites, I am on my way.</p>
<p>Especially, if the invitation is before Spring Equinox.</p>
<p>Prior to arriving, told Don that we should watch a spring baseball game.</p>
<p>He and Spencer made arrangements.</p>
<p>And just like that we were at the Diablo Stadium. Watching the <code>Texas Rangers</code> play the <code>LA (California) Angels</code></p>

<p>What a venue for a baseball game, or any event.<br>
I had visited this complex during my traveling days.<br>
I wanted to watch a game in person,</p>
<p><img src="https://spencerirvinereed.github.io/spencer/posts/A March Weekend/baseball_image.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We were like foreigners following their teams. Traveling abroad to watch them play – even if it a spring practice game.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t the game that entertained and enlightened us.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>For we had a personal baseball commentator, a historian, and the current event interpreter sitting with us.</p>
<p>Spencer had us relaxed, think about ourselves and in turn think about life.</p>
<p>While sitting in an open stadium, feeling the sun with bit of clouds on an early desert spring afternoon.</p>
<p>There was no need for a preparation, just be there and enjoy the conversation.</p>
<p>Thank you Don. Thank you Spencer</p>
