## Alfredo Lopez's Memories

Spencer Irvine was incredibly sweet, kind, smart and funny. 

We spent 3 years together in early morning seminary and he was still all of those things at 6am! 

I can still hear his great laugh and I will never forget him as Mr. Mumbles in the road show! 

Sending all my love and prayers to the Irvine family during this time.

The pic says it all: Spencer could light up a room (mostly because he was hilarious). Losing him hurts…Real bad. Sending love and prayers to the Irvine family.

Spencer thank you for being such a great friend. I remember how kind you were to me and my mom when we first moved into Derwood Ward. All the great times we spent at camp outs, youth activities and just hanging out together as friends. You will be missed my Brother. May you rest in peace in Heaven.
