Time with Spencer and Don, means discussion will flow, no set topic.

There is no way to prepare for it, just enjoy it.

Don and Young were visiting our sister in AZ in late March.

Jumped at the opportunity to join them.

We always talked about watching a baseball game in AZ.

Like having a personal play-by-play announcer and color commentator, a historian sitting next to you.
