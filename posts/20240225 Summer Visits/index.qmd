During growing up years, each summer brought us together, whether in Maryland, Utah or even Korea.

You came and each summer we could see you grow.

As it says in Luke

Spencer had no problem talking to other people, whether they were older or more seasoned.

Absorbed all things, with contemplation.

Thankful for those times in a far away place
