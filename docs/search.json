    "text": "Our beloved husband, son, brother, and uncle Spencer Reed Irvine, passed away peacefully on the evening of 24 September 2023 in Scottsdale, Arizona after a courageous bout with cancer.\nSpencer was born on 13 February 1988 in Rockville, Maryland.\nHe excelled in all areas of endeavors in life, yet he was humble and a friend to all.\nHe embodied a gentle kindness to all and was a source of many excellent conversations.\nHe graduated from Brigham Young University, with an International Relations degree.\nHe obtained a Master of Public Administration from George Washington University.\nHe served in the California San Fernando Mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.\n\nHis hobbies and enjoyment included history, sport analytics, writing in areas of policies and politics, these shaped his life.\nHis talent for writing came from an accurate assessment of himself, grounded in his faith in Jesus Christ, and his surroundings.\nOften drawing and building upon an initial assessment then rigorously testing his thesis and rewriting as many times as necessary to satisfy his high standard.\nPerhaps he gained this skill through his father, Don, and also his grandfather Reed.\nBoth of whom adored Spencer and influenced his outlook and shaped his core.\nFrom his mother, Young Kang Irvine, Spencer learned hard work and perseverance ‚Äì a first generation Korean immigrant.\nSpencer had great interest in the service of Grandpa Kang in the Korean War and had researched into the battles that Grandpa was involved in.\nWhether the setting was academic, religion, or work, Spencer applied all his faculties and energy.\nAnd most responded because they all felt his sincerity and love, which Spencer was blessed with in abundance.\n\nMany select and establish their North Star and an internal compass, and means to reckon and keep track of passage of time to guide their journey in this life.\nSpencer was gifted with an absolute and abiding True North and built himself a never deviating compass, and fashioned a perpetual time keeping method ‚Äì all based on his faith in Jesus Christ, an understanding of the Will of the Father, and immense love for his fellow travelers.\nHe knew the purpose of this life, to love others as they need to be loved, without pre-condition or judgment.\nForever grateful that we got to know him and feel his love, taking a part in this journey together.\nWe have lost a guide, and the pain persists.\nHe was a leader that showed how to comfort and heal one another.\nSpencer is survived by his love of life Meg Nu√±ez Irvine, loving parents Don and Young, siblings Kristy (Tyler) and Steven (Bree).\nThe funeral services will be held on Saturday, 30 September 2023, 10AM.\n(Viewing will be from 9AM to 9:45AM)\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at 3920 N 44th Pl, Phoenix, AZ 85018.

Your time on this earth may have been short, but your wonderful memories will remain with us forever.\nOur lives are extra special for having been blessed with your wonderful presence.\nYou will be so dearly missed.\nSoar high, Spence. We love you.‚ù§Ô∏è"
