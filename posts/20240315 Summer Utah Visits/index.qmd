Thinking back to times we traveled to destinations in Utah.  
We visited from Arches to Zion and places near and far.

That visit to Vernal to visit the Dinosaur Museum.   
And that time catching crawfishes along the shores of Soldier Creek.

Our favorite was lining the streets of Provo to watch the Freedom Parade in July.
We attended several editions of that parade.

That year we got to seat across from the old Provo High.

Thank you Spencer for your visits and enriching our summer.

With fond and lasting memories of times shared.
