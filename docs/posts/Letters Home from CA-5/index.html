<p>Querida Familia Irvine:</p>
<p>As for the overcoat, depends on how much it costs to send the coat.</p>
<p>If it’s a lot, I’ll just endure the cold because it’s not worth a fortune.</p>
<p>And, P-days are too short to get everything done including shopping for coats.</p>
<p>As for packages, it’d be great!</p>
<p>Talks on CDs, music, and whatever you feel like sending.</p>
<p>I still haven’t finished the food you sent me way back when, like the instant rice and stuff since the members feed us A LOT!</p>
<p>Please don’t send me too much this time!</p>
<hr>
<p>Pres.&nbsp;Goodrich probably said I’ll stay with my comp, who is amazing.</p>
<p>I’m excited.</p>
<p>Start the week off great, I love my investigators and I love teaching them with the Spirit.</p>
<p>We doubled attendance this week because Elder <code>N</code> and I visited almost every single person in the chapel yesterday.</p>
<p>Saturday was, by far, the best day even though it was the busiest ever!</p>
<p>We ended up going to a less active’s house, the <code>S</code>s, whose Christian daughter called us blasphemers not too long ago.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to go, but Elder <code>N</code> was like ‘c’mon Elder Irvine’ so we did.</p>
<p>We get there and knock on the door, the daughter opens the door and had us come in.</p>
<p>We found out that her mom, the member, nearly died half and hour ago with severe drops in sugar level.</p>
<p>And, her mom prayed for the missionaries to come.</p>
<p>Her daughter knew it was an answer to her mother’s prayer.</p>
<p>We helped her move some things around the home, and sat down to talk.</p>
<p>They gave us tamales and then, the bombshell.</p>
<p>The daughter said that her trials are overwhelming, and that she wants to read the Bible and gain comfort from it.</p>
<p>She asked us <em>gasp</em> to teach her from the scriptures.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>What a change!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first time I went there I nearly cried because she called us blasphemers, and now she wants us to teach her? Wow!</p>
<p>So that was a pleasant surprise (understatement).</p>
<p><img src="orem.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<hr>
<p>We went to another investigator’s home, not home, so we went to give a blessing to a member in Canyon Country and took a 15 minute nap.</p>
<p>It was good, because we needed it later.</p>
<p>Zipped in, blessed her son with a blessing of comfort.</p>
<p>The mother is a perfectionist, poor kid, she was mad he wasn’t being the #1 student and was just being pretty mean in my opinion.</p>
<hr>
<p>So we zipped over to another member, who is really sick.</p>
<p>We gave her a blessing and left to find a referral.</p>
<p>We got lost a bit, and finally found it. Not home.</p>
<p>Along the way, we stopped the car when we saw two black hoodlums walking.</p>
<p>We asked them directions,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>‘Hey, do you know where West Ness is?’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the kid closest to us shook and freaked out.</p>
<p>Then they said,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>‘Naw, man’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And we finally found it.</p>
<p>It was hilarious! If you saw his reaction, oh my goodness! That made my day.</p>
<hr>
<p>Quick lunch then off to contact in the park IN THE COLD. It was at least 40 plus wind chill.</p>
<p>But, we found an elect family.</p>
<p>This entire week, we’ve had some trouble finding the elect.</p>
<p>We set an hour apart in a specific place to find an elect, and we finally got one on Saturday!</p>
<p>We’re going to teach them in the next few days.</p>
<hr>
<p>Frozen, but excited, we found another recent convert and cleared up some of his doubts about priesthood, then finally went back to Newhall, 30 minutes away.</p>
<p>Less active wasn’t home, so we went to eat dinner…which was just fantastic!</p>
<p>Eating dinner at the <code>U</code>s is like going to a buffett, he gives us a LOT of food!</p>
<p>And, he’s an RM so he knows what’s up with the ward.</p>
<p>He’s our ear, our inside man.</p>
<p>We finished the ward mission plan on his comp and gave it to him.</p>
<hr>
<p><img src="snow.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>We got to the <code>J</code>s home 30 minutes late, but our member fellowshippers were there!</p>
<p>I love familia <code>C</code>! We taught and testified about the Holy Ghost, and the Spirit was strong.</p>
<p>We got home, planned, and crashed really fast.</p>
<p>I have never been so tired than I was Saturday.</p>
<p>And guess what, the mother, daughter, and son came to church yesterday!</p>
<p>The oldest son is in Mexico with the soccer team and the dad was busy.</p>
<p>But, they are progressing! I was so happy to see them yesterday.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Lord is blessing us with the elect, two days in a row, and we are still going to go out there and do His work. Regardless of what happens,</p>
<p>I’m going to be His representative and going to do His work and His will.</p>
<p>Something my comp pointed out to me was that we are literally God’s representatives, that people reject us, they reject God.</p>
<p>We can’t disobey the rules, because we are in His stead.</p>
<p>It’s as if we are Him when we are in the mission field.</p>
<p>It’s motivated me to be a better missionary, to actually make good contacts, teaching moments, whatever you call them, on the streets.</p>
<p>My brothers and sisters are waiting for this Gospel, I just have to testify and teach.</p>
<p>What a great message, what a marvelous work!</p>
<p>I am sad to say, I am hitting my 6 month mark.</p>
<p>I am sad, I don’t want time to fly so fast!</p>
<p>I want to go back to the beginning and do it over again!</p>
<p>I don’t want to look back and say…if I only had done this…or that…if I only had the knowledge I have now.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I love this mission, I love this work, I, most of all, love my Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has blessed me with the gift of tongues, He has picked me up from the lowest points of the mission so far, and He has blessed me immensely.</p>
<p>How I love my Lord, my God! As Alma says, if I were an angel of God and go about with the trump of God!</p>
<p><img src="ray.jpeg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>Dad- I love you, my loving and righteous father. If only I could make you more proud, if only I could show you how much I miss you. Thank you for working hard, thank you for being who you are.</p>
<p>Mom- I love you, my exemplary mother and caregiver. I can’t say how much I appreciate your words, your packages, and most of all, your love. I miss you.</p>
<p>Steven- Don’t miss church! I love you, my caring, loving, loyal, and most of all, worthy brother. You are my brother, and I know that you are the best brother I could ever have. I love you, and keep up the good work.</p>
<p>Grandma- I love you, my always polite, courteous, humble, and unique grandmother. I hope that all is well, that you love your Japanese DVDs, and that you can look forward to my phone call soon. Only less than a month to go!</p>
<p>Kristy- I love you, just keep it up! It’s hard enough contacting for 3-4 hours, but the work will progress. I thought Spanish work is easy, it isn’t at all! The investigators will love you, the Lord loves you, and will bless you. The blessings are around the corner, as my mission president said. Just be yourself. You’d probably kick all the sister missionaries’ tail out here with all that hard work you do!</p>
<p>I love you all, and I’ll talk to you soon.</p>
<p>Love, Elder Irvine</p>
<p>P.S. If you could send my companion Elder <code>S</code> a Christmas card or something, he’d appreciate it so much. I know he would appreciate a card from the best family in the world! Thank you!</p>
