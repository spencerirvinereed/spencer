Four adults and 4 children are travelling from Utah to Arizona.

To attend the wedding of my sister.

My father, your father, my cousin are matched to, you, your sister, my son and daughter.

---

The wedding was held in June because, my sister wanted you and your sister to be there -- after the summer break starts.

---

A day before the wedding, the family was sealed in the Mesa Temple.

My father, my mother, my 2 sisters and all the rest of the family members sealed as a family.

The wedding began early on June 25th

You and your brother wore matching outfits.

I remember your brother, 2 at the time, was looking for his Dad.  He grabbed a leg of a nearby person, since he couldn't see beyond their legs.

One purpose of that trip was to attend the wedding of your aunt. 

But we also gathered to be united eternally as a family unit.

It is good to remember that journey a long ago.
Grateful that we took part and made promises to God and to one another.
