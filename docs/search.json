    "text": "Our beloved husband, son, brother, and uncle Spencer Reed Irvine, passed away peacefully on the evening of 24 September 2023 in Scottsdale, Arizona after a courageous bout with cancer.\nSpencer was born on February 13, 1988 in Rockville, Maryland.\nHe excelled in all areas of endeavors in life, yet he was humble and a friend to all.\nHe embodied a gentle kindness to all and was a source of many excellent conversations.\nHe graduated from Brigham Young University, with an International Relations degree.\nHe obtained a Master of Public Administration from George Washington University.\nHe served in the California San Fernando Mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nHis hobbies and enjoyment included history, sport analytics, writing in areas of policies and politics, these shaped his life.\nHis talent for writing came from an accurate assessment of himself, grounded in his faith in Jesus Christ, and his surroundings.\nOften drawing and building upon an initial assessment then rigorously testing his thesis and rewriting as many times as necessary to satisfy his high standard.\nPerhaps he gained this skill through his father, Don, and also his grandfather Reed.\nBoth of whom adored Spencer and influenced his outlook and shaped his core.\nFrom his mother, Young Kang Irvine, Spencer learned hard work and perseverance – a first generation Korean immigrant.\nSpencer had great interest in the service of Grandpa Kang in the Korean War and had researched into the battles that Grandpa was involved in.\nWhether the setting was academic, religion, or work, Spencer applied all his faculties and energy.\nAnd most responded because they all felt his sincerity and love, which Spencer was blessed with in abundance.\n\nMany select and establish their North Star and an internal compass, and means to reckon and keep track of passage of time to guide their journey in this life.\nSpencer was gifted with an absolute and abiding True North and built himself a never deviating compass, and fashioned a perpetual time keeping method – all based on his faith in Jesus Christ, an understanding of the Will of the Father, and immense love for his fellow travelers.\nHe knew the purpose of this life, to love others as they need to be loved, without pre-condition or judgment.\nForever grateful that we got to know him and feel his love, taking a part in this journey together.\nWe have lost a guide, and the pain persists.\nHe was a leader that showed how to comfort and heal one another.\nSpencer is survived by his love of life Meg Nuñez Irvine, loving parents Don and Young, siblings Kristy (Tyler) and Steven (Bree).\nThe funeral services will be held on Saturday, September 30, 2023, 10AM.\n(Viewing will be from 9AM to 9:45AM)\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at 3920 N 44th Pl, Phoenix, AZ 85018.

How great thou art! Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee, How great thou art!

Then I shall bow in humble adoration And there proclaim, “My God, how great thou art!” [Chorus]"

Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!

    "text": "Kristy Irvine\nMy hope and prayer today is that the the spirit can be with me.\nTo help me get through this.\nIt took a long time for me to think about how I could give Spencer, a proper tribute to, who he was.\nMy dear brother Spencer left this mortality too soon, but not without making his mark in this world.\nHe lived his life in accordance with the principles that he knew to be true and aligned his life with the will of our savior Jesus Christ.\nI think that it can be said of him, that like Nephi\n\nI glory in plainness,\nI glory in truth, I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul.\n\nSpencer loved the Gospel of Jesus Christ and embodied it, and in all that he did. Even as a child, he could recognize true principles and devoted his life to the savior and our Heavenly Father.\nHe was a black and white kind of guy. He could see right. And he knew when things were wrong.\nOne of my favorite things that we talked about this week was, that even in preschool, when he was interviewed for a new story about missing school, he told the reporter that he missed school because he wanted to play.\nAnd those were facts.\nThere’s a small section of a talk given by Michelle Craig that I would like to read because we can insert Spencer’s name into it and see him in it, she says.\n\n“When hard times come, I try to remember that I chose to follow Christ before I came to Earth and that challenges to my faith, my health and my endurance are all part of the reason I’m here.\nAnd I certainly should never think that today’s trial calls into question God’s love for me or let it turn my faith in him into doubt.\nTrials do not mean that the plan is failing.\nThey are part of the plan, meant to help me seek God.\nI become more like him when I endure patiently and hopefully like him when in agony.\nI pray more earnestly.\nJesus Christ was the perfect example of loving our father with all his heart, of doing his will and regardless of the cost, I want to follow his his example by doing the same”\n\nSpencer embodied so many Christ-like attributes throughout his short time here on Earth.\nHe was full of faith in Jesus Christ.\nHe fully accepted him as his personal Savior and Redeemer, and looked to Him in all things.\nIn Preach My Gospel, which is a guide for all members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nIt says that faith leads to action, and when you have faith in Jesus Christ, you accomplish what the Lord wants you to accomplish. And you help bring about good in your own life and the lives of others.\nSpencer was always doing good in his life. He served others.\nHe remembered birthdays. He apologized for not remembering birthdays.\nAnd he was always one to help when needed. Spencer was full of hope. He hoped for a better future for himself and Meg, and always look forward, not back.\nHe was patient, optimistic and persevered through his multiple surgeries, injuries, his recent diagnosis.\nAnd in every trial that he faced, his eye was fixed firmly upon the Savior.\nPresident James E Faust taught, hope is the anchor of our souls.\nSpencer lived his life full of hope.\nA man once asked Jesus which is the great commandment in the law.\nJesus replied,\n\nThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment, and the second is like unto it. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\n\nSpencer did this his entire life.\nHe put the Lord first.\nHis friends knew what he stood for and what he wouldn’t say or do.\nSpencer listened to those around him and loved them unconditionally.\nHe served a full time mission in California, and his letters were always full of love for those around him.\nWhenever I would text Spencer, he was quick to offer a kind word.\nHe supported me with love and was slow to anger.\nHis life was a life of charity, the pure love of Christ was part of who he was.\nSpencer was a true disciple of Christ.\nElder De Feo. said in a talk entitled Pure Love, the true sign of every disciple of Jesus Christ said4.\n\nTrue disciples love to submit themselves to the Lord with peace in their heart. They are humble and submissive because they love him. They have faith to fully accept his will, not only in what he does, but also in how and when.\n\n\nTrue disciples know that the real blessings are not always what they want, but rather what the Lord wants for them.\n\nHis humility and willingness to submit to the will of The Lord was and is inspiring.\nSpencer went through periods of unemployment which to us is very disappointing and many when faced with this challenge can become despondent and even quick to anger with the Lord for not helping answer prayers for good employment.\nSpencer did everything that he could to provide for himself and Meg, even taking jobs that were not equal to his education or talents.\nBut they were jobs that would allow him to provide. His humility and submission to the Lord, yielded great results with a job that Spencer truly loved.\nElder De Feo also said pure love is the true sign of every true disciple of Jesus Christ.\nI’m sure many of you have memories of Spencer embodying this statement. His love was pure, it was unfettered from judgment and hostility.\nHe was a happy person who loved unconditionally.\nHe laughed with so many, he welcomed all.\nHe threw himself into youth activities and was always the first to offer a smile, tell a good joke and ask if anyone needed help.\nSpencer loved his family.\nHe devoted his time to his sweetheart, Meg, and gave her everything that he could offer and the circumstances that they lived in.\nHe loved everything about his nieces and nephews.\nAnd would gush over their photos and celebrate their accomplishments and encourage them when I would tell him of a struggle in their life.\nIn closing, I want to share a few thoughts on the resurrection. As we look to that day with longing and hope of seeing our dear Spencer again\nThe following is taken from a talk called Sunday Will Come, by Elder Wirthlin5.\n\nPresident Joseph F. Smith said “that those from whom we have to part here, we will meet again and see as they are. We will meet the same identical being that we associated with here in the flesh.”\n\n\nPresident Spencer W. Kimball amplified this when he said, “I am sure that if we can imagine ourselves at our very best, physically, mentally, spiritually, that is the way we will come back.”\n\n\n“When Christ rose from the grave, becoming the first fruits of the Resurrection, He made that gift available to all. And with that sublime act, He softened the devastating, consuming sorrow that gnaws at the souls of those who have lost precious loved ones.\nI think of how dark that Friday was when Christ was lifted up on the cross.\nOn that terrible Friday the earth shook and grew dark. Frightful storms lashed at the earth.\nThose evil men who sought His life rejoiced. Now that Jesus was no more, surely those who followed Him would disperse. On that day they stood triumphant.\nOn that day the veil of the temple was rent in twain.\nMary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Jesus, were both overcome with grief and despair. The superb man they had loved and honored hung lifeless upon the cross.\nOn that Friday the Apostles were devastated. Jesus, their Savior—the man who had walked on water and raised the dead—was Himself at the mercy of wicked men. They watched helplessly as He was overcome by His enemies.\nOn that Friday the Savior of mankind was humiliated and bruised, abused and reviled.\nIt was a Friday filled with devastating, consuming sorrow that gnawed at the souls of those who loved and honored the Son of God.\nI think that of all the days since the beginning of this world’s history, that Friday was the darkest.\nBut the doom of that day did not endure.\nThe despair did not linger because on Sunday, the resurrected Lord burst the bonds of death. He ascended from the grave and appeared gloriously triumphant as the Savior of all mankind.\nAnd in an instant the eyes that had been filled with ever-flowing tears dried. The lips that had whispered prayers of distress and grief now filled the air with wondrous praise, for Jesus the Christ, the Son of the living God, stood before them as the first fruits of the Resurrection, the proof that death is merely the beginning of a new and wondrous existence.\nEach of us will have our own Fridays—those days when the universe itself seems shattered and the shards of our world lie littered about us in pieces. We all will experience those broken times when it seems we can never be put together again. We will all have our Fridays.\nBut I testify to you in the name of the One who conquered death—Sunday will come. In the darkness of our sorrow, Sunday will come.\nNo matter our desperation, no matter our grief, Sunday will come. In this life or the next, Sunday will come.\nI testify to you that the Resurrection is not a fable. We have the personal testimonies of those who saw Him. Thousands in the Old and New Worlds witnessed the risen Savior. They felt the wounds in His hands, feet, and side. They shed tears of unrestrained joy as they embraced Him.\nAfter the Resurrection, the disciples became renewed. They traveled throughout the world proclaiming the glorious news of the gospel.\nHad they chosen, they could have disappeared and returned to their former lives and occupations. In time, their association with Him would have been forgotten.\nThey could have denied the divinity of Christ. Yet they did not. In the face of danger, ridicule, and threat of death, they entered palaces, temples, and synagogues boldly proclaiming Jesus the Christ, the resurrected Son of the living God.\nMany of them offered as a final testimony their own precious lives. They died as martyrs, the testimony of the risen Christ on their lips as they perished.\n\nMy hope is that as Spencer passed through the veil, he could he could hear the words of Paul in his mind.\n\nThe time in my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith.\n\nMay we all remember our dear friend Spencer and the compass that he used to guide his life, the Savior, Jesus Christ.\nMay we take the example that Spencer set for us and following the Savior that we may invite the Savior more fully into our lives and willingly give our shortcomings to him that he may help us be perfect in Him.\nMy testimony is that Sunday will come that glorious day when we will be reunited with those we love and rejoice in the great gift that the Savior has given us through his sacrifice in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen."

    "text": "Steven Irvine\nSpencer was a special person.\nAs you heard from Kristy, he was the most Christ like.\nKind, caring, loving person that I know.\nHe was the best older brother. He was the best friend. And the best example, that I could have.\nThis week has been a week of reflection for me\nI tried to figure out and appreciate how much my life was influenced by my older brother and the 31 years that I was able to spend with him.\nI realized I attribute so much of who I am to who he was And how much I wanted to be like him.\nGrowing up, I shared a room with him and we always talked before going to bed in our little bunk beds.\nAll of my hobbies, all of my knowledge came from his influence. And because he loved history and civil war, so I know about Antietam and Gettysburg Because he was so obsessed with those things and we’d go on these trips over to Virginia and have fun as a family.\nBecause that’s what Spencer loved. I just wanted to be there with him and I wanted to learn about these that he loved.\nMy love for all sports comes from his nerdiness.\nAll thosee stats that he knew and I’m going to miss texting\n\nhey, what do you think about this guy\n\nAnd he would text me back all these stats.\nThat’s just who he was.\nHe was so loving and knowledgeable. He just gave everything his all, I always wanted to follow in his footsteps.\nI wanted to be the college football fan that could talk football with my brother. I wanted to play the video games, growing up with my brother and my sister, and have fun playing Mario Kart with them.\nI just wanted to be him.\nThat’s what what I’ve realized over this last week. I really wanted to be my brother.\nBecause he just set such a good example for me.\nHow to be man How to be an adult. How to be a spouse.\nBecause he adored Meg and he treated her like a queen. And I thought to myself one day I want to love somebody like that because I saw how much he loved her.\nHe was everything I could ask for from an older brother. He was truly the best example. He had the best laugh, even though it was a little too loud.\nWe all loved it.\nYou can read all the hundreds of Facebook comments about him and his contagious laughter, with his big smile and how it just came out of his chest.\nAnd you knew exactly where he was at all times.\nHe had so much fun with everything that he did and he just loved life so much.\nAnd there’s a word that I was thinking of. How do I how do I explain who Spencer was? To somebody who didn’t know my older brother.\nThe word is Vigor. And that’s just how Spencer lived.\nHe lived with so much vigor, he loved life, he loved everybody.\nHe was everybody’s best friend. He talked to people on the airplane. Who does that? But that was Spencer.\nHe was everybody’s best friend. He always had a smile on his face.\nIf you look at any of those pictures, you knew he was a happy person. And he was so Christ like.\nHe was so loving. He was so caring. And it’s just as my sister said. He leaves such a big hole in our family.\nAnd now, as I try to compare myself to him,\nHe would call my parents out of the blue to check up on them.\nI call my parents to get something from them, or ask them a question. But Spencer cared about how my dad’s day was going. While I was like,\n\noh, I could call my dad today, I guess, but…\n\nHe just he loved them so much and he was just such a good son.\nHe was my dad’s best friend. He always thought about them. He always thought about other people, even when he was sick last Wednesday.\nOut of the blue, he called me – four times. I thought this was strange.\nI was working and I missed the calls. I thought it was weird that he called me four times and he left me a voicemail.\nAnd the voicemail starts off with.\n\nLove you little bro. Thank you so much for praying for us and all the support.\n\nAnd then he ends it with\n\nlove you so much. Take care, Steven.\n\nAnd I didn’t at the time, I didn’t think much of it Because well, we will have time with him. But, why did he call me? On a Wednesday during a work day.\nWhy did he feel like he had to call me so many times and I ended up calling him back and we had a really great chat for 45 minutes.\nThat was the last time I spoke to him.\nBut he knew somehow that he needed to leave me this message that I’m going to cherish for the rest of my life.\nHe knew that he needed to call me then because he wasn’t going to have an opportunity again.\nHe knew that he just needed to talk to me. Somehow some way Spencer knew.\nDespite feeling low, despite being bloated and having pain and being on painkillers. Knowing that there was a very grim prognosis for him, he called me in the middle of the week, last Wednesday.\nTo tell me that he loved me.\nBecause that’s just who he was.\nI couldn’t imagine my life without him.\nNo matter what I did, he was always the prouder, older brother.\nEven when he was unemployed and struggling and really challenged. I got a job and I started moving up the ladder and he was always so proud of me.\nAnd looking back\nIf I were in his shoes, I’d be thinking,\n\nwhat a little punk. Why does he get a job. How is he doing this and I’m not? I have the master’s degree.\n\nThere would be so many things going through my mind of how I would have reacted to these negative situations.\nBut Spencer didn’t.\nEvery time I texted him, he was always so proud of me. He was always so happy for me.\nI don’t know how I would have reacted to all that. I don’t know how I would have been non judgmental. Or not angry? At all of these circumstances that happened to me.\nBut no matter what, he was just such a trooper. He was always so positive in the middle of all. Whether his diagnosis or Doctor visits, he would call me and tell me.\n\nYou know what? I’m going to beat this thing. I’m going to stay positive. I’m going to do it. And we’re going to beat it.\n\nHe had so much hope. And so much love.\nI remember one of the last things he told me on that Wednesday.\nHow amazing our family has been for him. How much support his friends and family have given him all across the world. How amazing his wife was for doing everything for him, taking him to the ER all those times and bearing that burden with him.\nAs I look throughout the years and I think of how amazing of an older brother he was.\nEvery situation that I would have reacted negatively, he reacted positively.\nEvery person that he met, he left with a good impression When I probably would have been judgmental.\nHe was a better man.\nHe was so positive. So Christ like So loving.\nHe set a good example for me, despite everything that he faced. He was always encouraging me, always trying to teach me and be the supportive older brother that he knew that he needed to be.\nAnd last Saturday, before we came down to Arizona on Sunday, for the first time in years, I watched college football in our basement.\nI said to myself,\n\nWow, this would be really fun if Spencer gets his chemo treatment and he feels good enough, one day I’ll fly him up here so we can have another college football Saturday that we used to have growing up.\n\nI felt a little bit of Spencer next to me. Looking back at it, it feels very surreal that I almost felt like I had him with me. For that one day, the day before he passed, I decided to watch college football. That I decided to do that one thing that he loves so much doing with me.\nAnd I felt him and that a little part of him was there with me I will cherish that moment for the rest of my life.\nI love my brother so much.\nHe’s such a good example to me. He was the most Christlike person that I know. And I will miss him dearly.\nAnd I want to close this with my testimony. I know that I’m going to see him again. And I can’t wait to see him and get one of those big bear hugs that he always gives.\nBecause I’m already missing those.\nI know that he’s watching over us. And I know that the plan of salvation is real and I can’t wait to see him again.\nI say that in the name of Jesus Christ."

    "text": "Alfredo Lopez\nGood morning. My name is Alfredo and like all of you, I had the privilege of calling Spencer, my friend.\nI want to give a tribute to Spencer and tell you all the amazing adventures that we went on.\nI really don’t remember my life Without Spencer.\nWhen my family moved to the United States from Lima, Peru. Spencer was literally one of my first friends.\nSo I literally don’t remember much at all the adventures we’ve been on while Spencer being there with me, - or me calling him, - or reaching out to him, - or sending him pictures, - or him sending me pictures back, - or something awesome that we were doing.\n\nWe we went to middle school together. We went to Argon Middle school. And we have a social studies class together.\nAnd I was still learning English. And island is spelled ISLAND, right?\nThe S is silent. So you say island. And I was in the class and I said Iceland because I pronounce the S because in Spanish you pronounce all the letters.\nSpencer was like.\nNo, no, don’t say it like that,\nI’m like, why not? Are you sure that doesn’t sound right?\nBut and then I told the teacher, I asked her about the Iceland. And she said, we’re talking about Islands\nI was like, Oh.\nThat was my relationship with Spencer.\n\nI called Spencer my personal political adviser.\nWhenever I needed something or I needed to know something.\n\nWhat’s going on?\n\nI always call Spencer or text him.\nI’ll say,\n\nHey Spencer. What is going on with this cause? He already knew about it, had done all the research on it and so he gave me all the information.\n\nHe gave me the Cliff notes as well. And it was amazing.\nSpencer was also my mentor – always.\n\nI was conflicted whether or not to wear my service uniform today. But I’m wearing it, to honor Spencer.\n10 years ago I enlist in the Marine Corps. I now serve in the army. When I was going through the process of which branch to join, who do you think I was calling?\nI was calling Spencer. Because he knew all about the branches and what was going on with each one of them.\nSo when I went to see the Air Force recruiters, right after that, I called Spencer.\nWhen I went to see the Navy recruiters, then I called Spencer.\nBut not with the Army recruitors, since I didn’t want anything to do with the army.\nBut here I am.\nAnd then, I went to see the Marines recruiters, and I called Spencer.\nHe was like,\n\nyeah, you should do that one I think would be great.\n\nAnd it was terrible. It really was.\nThe training was horrible.\nBut I stuck through it. And when I graduated, the recruit training in San Diego. I called Spencer.\nI said, hey, man, I did it because of you\n\nSpencer and I, we grew up in what I now I’m calling The Fabulous 5.\nOur fearless leader, our Captain Moroni, was Spencer.\nHe was our righteous leader.\nFrom the moment we were deacons, he was a deacons president. And we knew that we had to follow Spencer because he was always ready to do the right thing no matter what it was. And he motivated us all to do it.\nPart of this gang was also Danny B., Michael S., Brandon R. and myself. Now the five of us we grew up together since we were 12, all he way to our missions and then we moved on with our lives\nBut during these formative years and our teenage years, looking back, Spencer was our rock.\nHe was so diligent, so smart.\nI was talking to Michael and he told me that he wanted to be a student like Spencer.\nSo he started meet up with Spencer to do his homework together because Spencer was a very serious student.\nOne thing about Spencer was his dilligence, he was amazing, I admire him for that.\nBut then Michael started to kind of corrupt Spencer.\nHe would say,\n\nhey, Spencer instead of doing homework, what if we played on the Xbox. Let’s go play some Battlefront\n\nAnd Spencer would respond,\n\nNo, we gotta do homework, man.\n\nBut Spencer was so nice, so he would crack down a few times. But then he was like, no, this isn’t right.\nWe’re not doing this.\n\nSpencer wasa really kind person and absolutely amazing.\nBut on the sports field he had no mercy.\nI hated to play against him any sport, whether it was soccer, football, basketball.\nBecause as sweet as Spencer is.\nOh my goodness. On the sports field he became a warrior.\nI ran so fast as to not get tackled by him.\nFor every Turkey Bowl, I always make sure I was on Spencer team. Because I didn’t want him chasing me down.\nAnd it was awesome to see when he joined the high school football team. He loved it and it was great.\nAnd I was so glad he was there because he was so tough.\nI like to consider myself tough, but no Spencer is tough, so much tougher than me.\n\nThen Spencer served mission in California and he learned that language de los ceielos\nThe tongue of the heavens.\nAnd when he came back and we met up after our missions.\nIt was a brand new world of our friendship, because now I still got Spencer, but we could also talk to the senoritas.\nI would say,\n\nlet’s go down some machaca and salsa,\n\nAnd Spencer was always down.\nHe was like,\n\nOK, let’s go.\n\nSo, Spencer, we’re gonna be coming home at 6:00 in the morning.\nHe would say,\n\nAlright, let’s do it.\n\nYou know, we took care of each other.\n\nIt was so beautiful to see how he now could communicate with my parents in a whole different way.\nGrowing up with Spencer and the Irvines, they were our families as well.\nAnd Spencer was so excited, I could see that excitement in his face when he first talked to my mom in Spanish.\nAnd his Spanish was amazing. You know, it was LA Spanish, which, we forgave him for that. But it was still amazing.\nAnd he would come and ask my mom for the recipes for Arroz con pollo and Huancaina, which are some Peruvian dishes, and he loved them.\nSpencer was always at the weddings of my family He was there when my sister got married. Also when I got married.\nIt was just awesome.\nBecause Spencer was my rock. He was also full of love. And so humble.\n\nThis was during one of our many, many camping trips with the scouts.\nFor some reason I didn’t have any warm gear and I was freezing.\nSpencer noticed that\n\nHey man, here, take my coat.\n\nI was like,\n\nno, no, you’re gonna need it because it was really cold.\n\nI think we were in mountains in western Maryland, Sugarloaf Mountains, and we spent all night trading the coat because I was freezing and he was freezing\nBut you know, we got some sleep.\nHe took care of me and I tried to take care of him.\nSince then, we grew into our 30s and moved on with our lives.\nI would, from time to time, would still check in with Spencer.\n\nIn the fall of 2021, I got assigned to be deployed to Eastern Europe for a year.\nIt said on my assignment, Kosovo and I was like, where is that?\nSo I made three phone calls.\nThe first one was my wife,\n\nI’m getting deployed. I’m leaving for a little bit.\n\nThen my parents, to let them know.\nThen Spencer, I was like,\n\nSpencer, what do you know about this place?\n\nand he already knew all about it.\nAnd I was like,\n\nAmazing.\n\nHe was my Intel guy to the Intel officer.\nIt was awesome, and even when I was gone, I would ask,\n\nhey, Spencer, what’s going on here\n\nHe would respond,\n\nlet me. Look up. I’ll get back to you.\n\nSo now, I don’t have that Intel guy anymore.\nFor now.\nBecause I know I will see him again.\n\nLast Friday, my brother texted me and said,\n\nhey, I think Spencer is sick.\n\nI said,\n\noh, let me hit him up, see what’s going on.\n\nSo last Saturday I called him.\n\nHey, Spencer, I heard you aren’t feeling well.\n\nAnd he filled me in\nAnd I told Spencer.\n\nYou have to beat this thing.\n\nBecause he had to meet my son, Levi Lopez. He was born 3 weeks ago.\nSpencer said,\n\nYES ~ I’m going to do this.\n\nAs Kristy and Steven said, Spencer was extremely positive.\nThe most positive person I’ve met.\n\n’Cause I’m gonna beat this thing and overcome.\n\nAnd I said, perfect.\nWhen you come back out to Maryland, I’m gonna kidnap you. Gonna go down to Virginia. We’re gonna hang out in the Potomac.\nIt’s gonna be amazing.\nHe will meet my children. And we will go… We will go on many more adventures.\nBecause that is what the gospel is all about.\nIt’s eternal relationships.\n\nFriends are like seasons.\nSome come and go, but not Spencer.\nHe was my rock.\nThis restored gospel is True. And I love it with all my heart. My testimony was stronger.\nBecause of Spencer.\n\nI remember the joy in his face when he opened his mission call.\nHe was going to learn Spanish, he was so pumped about that.\nI look forward to seeing my friend again. He is my brother.\nBecause I know I will because Christ came to the earth and he atoned for our sins. And He knew that Spencer was a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ.\nHe never wavered. He was one of the best examples for me.\n\nI called my dad and asked him how I should organized some of my thoughts today.\nHe replied with this.\nYou can cry because he’s gone. Or\nYou can smile because of the amazing life that he lived.\nYou can close your eyes and pray that he will come back right now. Or\nYou could open your eyes and look at everything that he did that he left behind.\nYour heart is void because he’s not here anymore. Or it could be full of joy because the good times you had with him.\nYou could cry. You could close your mind and feel the emptiness and turn around.\nOr you could do what he would have wanted you to do.\nWhich is to smile. Open your eyes and love. And endure to the end.\n\nAnd so that’s what I’m going to do. I’m going to smile and honor my friend.\nAnd remember all the great times we had.\nI’m going to love. I’m going to talk to people on airplanes.\nI’m going to be more attentive.\nI’m going to love deeply.\nBecause that’s what Spencer did. That is what I’m going to do — `till the end.\nBecause the only explanation that I have is this, that Heavenly Father needed Spencer. By His side.\nBecause that is how amazing he is. So I have to get there too\nI have to live this gospel and under the eternal covenants that we have with Heavenly Father.\n\nI’m so grateful to have the privilege to have spent my life with him. And for him to be my friend and my brother.\nMy family loves me so deeply.\nEvery single one of my siblings. There are six of us in total. We all have unique experiences with Spencer.\nWe all love him so much.\nThere isn’t a picture from our teenage years that are without Spencer in it.\nI know that this gospel is true. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is the only true church on this earth.\nSpencer knew it too.\nAnd he shared that message with everyone he met in California.\nThat was his mission.\nAnd so thankful for all of you, and for your support.\nAnd I say all these things. In the name of our savior, Jesus Christ, Amen."

    "section": "Bishop McCormack",
    "text": "Bishop McCormack\nTwo favorite songs that all primary children sing.\nI'm a child of God and Families Can Be Together Forever.\nTwo basic truths of the gospel.\nThank you to all family and friends for their beautiful messages and music this morning.\nThe Spirit was felt here in this Chapel.\nIf I can ask you to please take your hymnal out and turn to the hymn #86 that we sang this morning. (See Section 0.2)\nThis hymn was not written by Emma Smith or one of the members of the past as the majority of songs in this book were.\nWe adopted this hymn because it brings to the focus, the fundamental plan of happiness, the main theme in the Book of Mormon.\nIn the first verse, the prominent section gives God, the glory for creating a world where we could come to gain the experience we need to grow up.\nWe need to grow up to be like our Heavenly Father.\nPlease turn your attention to the next verse, which brings us to the experience. the wonders of this earth. And the joy within\nIn Galatians 5:22 and 23 , it reads.\n\nBut the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.\n\nThat’s what Spencer represented.\nWe are here to be happy.\nJoseph Smith said.\nIt is the the design of our existence.\nNow, as with all things, there needs to be an opposite. If not, we could not grow or have the agency to choose and make decisions for ourselves without depending on others to make them for us.\nTo be forced without agency is evil, and this is what the adversary wants. And since we are imperfect and expected to be imperfect, our Father’s Plan is to send His Son, His only begotten to redeem us from our imperfection, or save us from our mistakes.\nIn the third verse is the one that tears at me. It’s the one that when I ponder it, there’s something. There’s someone who loves me so much that would sacrifice Himself to go through such terrible experiences in the Garden of Gethsemane so that he can know my experiences of pain.\nThrough this act, in which no one understands how it works. He knows what we feel when someone we love without any fault of their own departs from this earth.\nAs the verse says. I scarce can take it in.\nHowever, brothers and sisters, there’s hope. Meaning, whether we believe it or not, there comes a time when the Savior will return to embrace and congratulate us.\nFor, as we say in our faith, endure to the end.\nThen I shall bow in humble adoration. And there proclaim my God. How great thou art.\nIn 2 Nephi 4, Lehi blesses his posterity and passes away.\nIn reading Nephi’s words, Nephi seem initially and understandably, to have a difficult time with his father’s passing.\nIn verse 13, Nephi stated that his brothers, Laman and Lemuel were angry with him.\nCan you imagine the scenario of all the trials that Nephi had gone through because of his brothers?\nAnd then on top of all of that, the Lord said,\n\nDon’t Nephi. You are not allowed to say anymore to them.\n\nFor the next few verses, Nephi remembers all that the Lord has done for him.\nHe remembers this because there was a choice he had to make.\nHe’s been through many afflictions and remember he’s grieving or mourning his father’s death.\nThis is what he said in verse 27.\n\nAnd why should I yield to sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why should I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in my heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry because of mine enemy?\n\nHe’s Speaking of Laman and Lemuel.\n\nAwake, my soul! No longer droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul.\n\n\nDo not anger again because of mine enemies. Do not slacken my strength because of mine afflictions.\n\nI ask you to please read the last five verses of the end of Nephi Chapter 4. Nephi pulls himself together and teaches us how to turn to the Lord to help in times of affliction.\nThese verses are very personal to him. And if you think of how he’s feeling when he writes these verses. There’s a parallel here with Nephi.\nDuring a very vulnerable time for him after losing his father. And with all of us grieving the loss of Spencer.\nIn my opinion, Nephi’s personal struggle and passion is more apparent in these verses than in any other of his writings.\nIn verse 30, it begins with this with this prayer and pleas. I ask you to put yourself in his place. And repeat this prayer in your mind. And Nephi asks that you pray unto the Lord in this manner.\nIn verse 30.\n\nO Lord, I will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee, my God, and the rock of my salvation.\n\n\nO Lord, wilt thou redeem my soul? Wilt thou deliver me out of the hands of mine enemies? Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the appearance of sin?\n\nHe continues, in verse 33\n\nO Lord, wilt thou encircle me around in the robe of thy righteousness! O Lord, wilt thou make a way for mine escape before mine enemies! Wilt thou make my path straight before me! Wilt thou not place a stumbling block in my way—but that thou wouldst clear my way before me, and hedge not up my way, but the ways of mine enemy.\n\n\nO Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh; for I know that cursed is he that putteth his trust in the arm of flesh. Yea, cursed is he that putteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm.\n\n\nYea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. Yea, my God will give me, if I bask cnot amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the drock of my erighteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen.\n\nI would like to bear in my testimony that I know God lives. He loves us. He sent his Son to redeem us.\nI know that Joseph Smith is a prophet of God And he translated the Book of Mormon by the power of God.\nI know that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the church here on this earth today\nAnd I know that this church is led by a prophet, a living prophet, who receives revelation\nThank you all for being here.\nMeg, We love you.\nWe love your family. Although for a short time, I know that they love you. You have such great support. And it goes without saying that Spencer was such a great guy.\nI leave you with a blessing that you will always stay close to the gospel. He’s smiling down and up on us right now.\nI know who he is.\nAnd I say these things, in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen."

Then he would, in a thoughtful and kind manner, explain the issue more fully and then offer some alternatives.\n\n\n\nNow days, alternate or artificial intelligence is the center of many discussions.\nAI has surpassed my understanding and will develop further.\nHowever, it will not reach the level of understanding the needs of the person, to tailor its response, quite the way Spencer was able to.\nFor all the learning, or Large Language Modelling, will not create an understanding of an individual.\nPerhaps the warning to Timothy from Paul applies,\n\nEver learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."

    "text": "When did you first meet Spencer (Elder Irvine)?\n\nI believe I first met Elder Irvine in 2009. I was in Van Nuys Ward at that time.\n\n\nWhat was your impression when you first met Elder Irvine and Erickson?\n\nWhen I opened my door, I felt like Elder Irvine and Elder Erickson were literally messengers from God.\nThey radiated goodness and love, so sweet and kind and excited to share the Gospel with me.\n\n\nCould you describe Elder Irvine reaction, when you told him, you have been waiting for them?\n\nInitially, I think my welcoming response, was totally unexpected to them.\nAnd then he asked me why I said that.\nI told him, I assumed my sister had given them my address.\nShe never gave up on me.\nCory, my sister, and I are very close.\nShe told me once that the only gift she wanted from me was to be temple worthy so I could be sealed to our parents.\nMy life had not been the best.\n\n\n\nWhat helped (prepared) you to meet these Elders and welcome them into your home?\n\nThere really was no preparation.\nI hadn’t consciously thought about it.\n\n\nWhat was it about Elder Irvine that made you trust in him?\n\nElder Irvine was one of the genuinely nicest people I ever met.\nHe radiated the spirit of the Lord.\nHe was truly concerned about me.\n\n\nWhat Christ-like qualities did E. Irvine possess?\n\nElder Irvine demonstrated these Christlike qualities\n\nHe loved our Heavenly Father.\nHe had charity in his heart,\nHe was kind to everyone.\nHe was reverent when teaching me.\nHe was an excellent teacher\nHe knew that his mission was a blessing from God.\nMostly, he was very patient with me.\n\n\n\nDo you recall an instance when Elder Irvine provided a Christ-like service?\n\nThe day he gave me my scriptures I cried.\nI hadn’t had my own scriptures for 30 years.\nI cried when I read the inscription:\n\n“Dear Betsy,\nGreat treasures of hidden wisdom are contained in this book.\n\n\nI know the truths in the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price will sustain you in your life’s trials. God will always be there for us.\n\n\nYou are great! God loves you. He wants you to be happy. He is your Father in Heaven. Take good care of yourself, and God will provide for you.\n\n\nLove, Elder Spencer Irvine\n\n\n\nWhat do you think is the purpose of the missionary work, as practiced in the LDS church?\n\nI believe that missionary work is to provide a way for us to return to our Father in Heaven.\nIt is up to us to listen and accept it.\nThey need to be true examples of Christ in all they do.\n\n\nSome words for the family of Elder Irvine.\n\nEven though Spencer was truly a messenger from God, he was also very funny.\nWhen the missionaries were working with me, they were at my house three or four times a week. They helped me decorate for holidays..\nHe especially loved all my Halloween decorations.\nSpencer taught me that even though I live by myself, I am never alone. My Savior is always with me.\nAs I write this tears stream down my face thinking of what the world has lost, but at the same time I am delighted in knowing Spencer is experiencing the Glory of God, as he continues to teach and waits to embrace those he loves as they join him in the eternities.\nThank you for this opportunity to express my feelings.\nPlease give Don a hug for me, I truly enjoyed meeting him.\nMay God bless you all in your time of grief and know that he and Spencer are smiling down on us each and every day.\n\nBetsy Miller"

    "text": "This area needs a lot of improvement, so that’s why I’m here I guess.\nIt’s so amazing though! Much prettier than the San Fernando Valley for sure.\nWhen I got to the area the first week, Elder N told me that he asked mission president to send him one of the hardest working missionaries that he has.\nI was touched to hear that from Elder N, because before I came here I had some doubts about my abilities, my purpose, if I was doing something wrong…but I’m very excited to be here now!\nThe investigators here are almost (casi) golden!\nJust a few commitments that they have to keep, but we’re working on them.\nOne family, the Js, are super golden!\nThe father can’t read, so we gave him Book of Mormon CDs so he can listen to them.\nBut, his family reads the Book of Mormon. I love them so much!\nWe have a great fellowshipping couple, the Cs (literally means eyebrow), and they bring the Spirit with them.\nHermano J said that\n\nhe feels something different when we’re here, that when the missionaries come there is peace and joy in their home.\n\n\nTears welled up in my eyes and I was overwhelmed by the Spirit. Hermana J cried a little too, I could see her wipe away some tears at the end.\nElder N then testified that it was the Holy Ghost that was with us, and that it is testifying to them that what we teach is from God.\nThey have the best potential out of all of our investigators.\nBefore I came here, we had 5 investigators in Arleta.\nNow, we have about 3 possibly golden, and a lot of potentials and ‘alright’ investigators.\nReflecting and talking about my previous area with my new comp makes me realize that I still have a lot to work on to receive these blessings.\nAnother family, the Ms, are amazing! They have a lot to learn, but they are looking for the truth.\nThey studied with the Jehovah’s Witnesses for a long time, but they stopped hearing them to hear us.\nThey had some deep questions, like is Jesus Christ Jehovah?\nSo we’re adjusting our lessons to ask them to believe on faith that what we teach is of God.\nThey’ve studied the Bible, and they know a good amount in my opinion.\nThe bishop is helping us out along with his wife, that was pretty sweet when they came and testified of what we taught.\nBut, Bishop A has a lot to learn still, he’s still learning the ropes of being bishop.\nThe second counselor is an RM, and he’s an excellent member.\nMarried, has two girls, and has a solid testimony. Hermano U is excited about missionary work, because he’s seen how important it is to the church’s progress in this ward.\nWe noticed that the bishop focuses on less actives, so we’re going to make an outline of what a ward mission plan should be then give it to Hermano U to submit to the bishopric.\nHe has had some great experiences in the mission field!\nWe have a potential, whose life has fallen apart.\nHis wife left him, he has two children, his oldest (son) is on drugs, his youngest has no one to take care for her except her mother, he is alone!\nI know I’m here for a reason, to bring these ‘great news’, that what Gospel means literally, to him and to other people like him!\n\nOh, how I love the mission!\n\n\nOur ward needs a ton of help.\nThe records haven’t been updated, so we have a lot of people (apparently, by word of Hermano U) that have moved.\nDoesn’t help the person in charge of it is semi-inactive (the Js) and apparently feels excluded by Latinos because he (the husband) is American and his wife is Dominican. Argh!\nBut, we do have a lot of RM’s. But, we don’t have the support of the priesthood at all.\nWe prepare the Sacrament, we bless the Sacrament, we teach Gospel Doctrine sometimes, the sisters teach Primary…we do almost everything!\nI thought that was only in South America! But, we can see that the work needs to progress, they’re people here ready to hear us!\nJust get to work…and it’s going to be slow, but it’ll work out in the end.\nI know it will, as long as the Spirit will lift us and strengthen us.\nYesterday, it was a great sacrament meeting.\nAll six of us missionaries bore our testimonies along with our spiritual conversion story.\nWe all went up, and it was great to see the happiness in the expressions of the members.\nI have been blessed with the gift of tongues.\nIt says so in my patriarchial blessing, and I know that when I speak, the Lord is guiding me to say what I need to say.\nIt’s hard to keep the language up sometimes since my comp likes to us English (but we can converse normally in Spanish) but not as much as Sandoval liked to us English.\nI feel my learning is expanding now.\nIt’s just I have to make language study a priority or my comp will schedule appointments during language study time. Never a good thing.\nAfter I bore my testimony, and how I knew this Church is of God, the members thanked us all for our testimonies.\nThey felt the Spirit.\nAnd, everyone was impressed by my Spanish.\nTo which I always say, I studied for 7 years before, the Lord is blessing me, I love being here.\nIt’s hard to not compare oneself to others, and I’m working on that.\nAt times I can get a big head, but I remember that this is the Lord’s work and I’m only an instrument.\nJust imagine, natives love my Spanish and I only have 3 months in the field…the Lord’s hand is in my life.\nI’ve been studying the Book of Mormon recently, and I’m impressed how faithful Nephi is to the Lord.\nNever murmured, never turned away, never asked ‘why me?’, but faithfully obeyed His will.\nNo wonder the Primary sings about him so much.\nI love one scripture, which was given in a talk by John Bytheway (great speaker by the way…haha).\n1st Nephi 11:17, when Nephi was talking to the Spirit. To paraphrase the verse, The Spirit asked what he knew about the condescension of God? To which Nephi said,\n\nI know God loves his children, but I do not know the meaning of all things.\n\nWe may never know why things are happening, but we know God loves EACH and EVERY one of us.\nWe can’t see his reasons why, but we know that God loves us.\nNo matter what happens, no matter what becomes of us, we know that there is a purpose in all the things we are going through.\nI suggest his book and/or talk, 5 Scriptures that Will Get You Through Almost Everything, or something like that. One great talk.\nI’m on the mission, being constantly tired and at times confused in my lessons, to learn.\nI’m with a veteran companion to learn how to be a leader.\nI’m in this area to teach families and bring them to Christ.\nHow can I know that I am setting these people on the path to the Celestial Kingdom?\nAs Pres. Eyring said, you know when the Spirit testifies through you in lessons, that when you love the people so much the Spirit will be brought into your lessons so strongly you can’t deny his presence.\nHow do I know?\nThe pure love of Christ and the hope that they will make it.\nIf the Spirit touches them and they are converted by the Spirit and Book of Mormon, you have done your part.\nWhat great comfort that gives me!\nHow do I know? By the Spirit. How do I know?\nIf they have a testimony of the Book of Mormon.\nI learned about the Pre-Existence two weeks ago, and I want to share some thoughts that I’ve had about it ever since.\nI’ll have to send you the scriptures, because I don’t have it with me right now.\nBut I know, after studying this topic, that we did live with God before this life. We were one of the chosen (Abraham saw it as did Joseph F. Smith in D&C 138), we were called before the foundation of this world, we were one of those who were victorious against Lucifer and his angels.\nWhat a great blessing it is to know we are special children of God, called forth to come here today, to lay the foundation of a great work.\nI know that I lived with God before.\nI progressed, but not as fast as others.\nI learned, but not as well as others.\nBut I know, I know that God lives. I know that God loves me. I know that God wants me here. I know that this work is leading so many people to Him, in His time, and I love being His instrument.\nA friend wrote me and reminded me to not be discouraged, because I am a part of this great work. I know God loves me, and every day is a testimony of His love for all his children.\nThe work is hard.\nInvestigators lie to us all the time, and we still love them.\nBut, the work will progress. I know it will. Just a little more love, a little more sacrifice, then we will receive blessings.\nMom- Thank you for your love. I love you.\nPlease, read the scriptures and bear your testimony as often as you can.\nYou will only grow in your testimony and in your gospel knowledge.\nDad- I love you. For your example, your dedication, your devotion, your faith. I hope you are proud of me, because I am proud of you.\nKristy- Keep up the good work. God loves you. God wants you to work. God wants you to keep being faithful and obedient, then the blessings will come. Numbers don’t matter, it is YOU who matters the most. I love you. I wish you the best.\nSteven- I love you, my ‘little’ but taller brother. Listen to the counsels of the apostles, prepare now! Prepare now for the mission! It is your calling! That’s why you’re here right now! If you have time, listen or read John Bytheway’s “What I Wish I Knew Before My Mission”, because I know that I wish I knew these things before I hit the MTC. Keep up the grades, keep the faith, use your priesthood worthily.\nGrandma- I love you, my beloved grandmother. Your life is full of sacrifice, and I love you for all you’ve done for me. God loves you. God wants you to be happy. This life isn’t the end of everything, it is only the beginning. I love you Grandma, and Happy Birthday!\nGosh, I wish I knew Korean! I need to learn when I get back! And, my favorite scripture is yet to be determined, I’ll get to you on that in my letter. Thanks for everything!\nI love you all, and I hope all is well in Zion!\nLove, Elder Irvine"

    "text": "Dear Family:\nI really thought that I ought to have done an April Fool’s number just to keep everyone on their toes.\nBut, I wouldn’t mind if that happens, but whatever the Lord wants.\nIt’s hard to keep working when one gets in a routine so I’ve been mixing things up a little bit to keep me balanced and not bored.\nYes, I got the traveler’s checks so I’ll cash it in soon.\nAnd I have so many pictures to send you, but I need the cord to burn it to a CD to send home.\nDon’t want a memory swipe to happen again.\nAnd that’s sweet that Steven is improving his grades - I’d love to see him out at BYU!\nIt’s the best thing to have siblings out at the same college so you’re not too lonely.\nThis weekend was edifying.\n\nI loved conference.\n\nI missed the main points of Elder Hales’ talk because I fell asleep during his talk and maybe another talk in that session.\n\nBut, it went well for me.\n\nI was really happy to hear Elder Bednar call the members out, because all the members pray for the missionaries but are really passive in helping us with better investigators than we can find their friends!\nThis conference was really great! I soaked in a lot.\n\nBednar’s was really great, Holland’s wasn’t as argumentative as his last one (I felt energized to go bash after last conference after hearing his talk), and I loved Uchtdorf’s talk in priesthood session.\nI learned so much, and the importance of prophets most of all.\nAlmost (if not) everyone mentioned they sustained the new prophet Thomas S. Monson and testified that the heavens aren’t closed.\nI really loved Holland’s talk, how he explained that if we believe in closed canon, we don’t believe God is the same as he was yesterday.\nIt was a weekend full of being edified by living scriptures. I can’t point out one that I really liked more than the rest.\nI am so grateful for a living prophet. It’s sad that people think God doesn’t talk to us anymore.\nWhen I teach, I ask people,\n\ndo you believe God is the same as he was yesterday?\n\nYes.\n\nSo do you believe that he has always called prophets?\n\nYes.\n\nSo would you think that he’d call prophets today? He’s the same, right?\n\nThey waffle on this one.\n\nDo we not need God’s help even more today?\n\nThey agree, then try to add something else. But, without a prophet, we are lost. God is really merciful with us.\n\nThis week was pretty busy, but relaxed at the end.\nA good finish.\nAt midweeks, we taught 15 lessons, probably one of the best weeks in the mission. I was really happy. We had 4 straight lessons on Tuesday, and that was really tiring!\nNo matter how hard we try to relax and regain strength each p-day (D&C 10:4 says don’t run faster than you have strength), never works.\nWe’re tired. Celestial fatigue…\nOur ‘golden’ investigator J is a bit questionable. He has quite a temper and is a bit too impatient. He’s been baptized in other churches, and I only found that out talking to his friend R (who’s a member).\nWe’re going to take our time with him, knowing he’s been baptized in several churches.\nIt ain’t a game, and I don’t believe he knows that yet.\nWe’ll see what he really feels when we take our time teaching him. But, he did come to watch conference.\nWe did have some good news with a woman we’ve been helping clean her house, P. She, at first, said she doesn’t want to hear our message, but wants us to come back and help her.\nBut, she was excited to hear General Conference, and she listened to the afternoon session on Sunday.\nSo she called us afterwards and asked many questions, which I hope I answered clearly for her understanding.\nShe said she felt great hearing their words, but they weren’t like TVN (televangelists) pastors.\nI nearly said, ‘well, we aren’t for entertaining and gaining money’.\nBut, I held my tongue because she loves watching TVN.\nShe’s progressing, slowly, but she’s opening up little by little. I feel good about her progress.\n\nA and Y are doing great!\nThey loved conference, and are just soaking everything in like a sponge. I am so happy they’re progressing a lot even after baptism.\nIt was strange because we had a lot more less active/recent convert lessons. We committed two of our less actives to meet with the bishop, and we’ll follow up on that.\nAnd our recent converts are strong as ever. It’s really too bad to know that it’s great that we do this, but this should be the job of the ward missionaries, home and visiting teachers that don’t exist right now.\nBut, the ward is working with it…we just have to be patient.\nI expressed this concern to the second counselor Hermano U, and he said it’s just a long process with this ward.\nHopefully, it’ll be done by the time I end my mission. If not…I don’t like to think about it.\nOne thing I learned from Hermano Pablo P was that the reason why John the Baptist was the Elias, was that he was waiting for the higher priesthood.\nHe told me that he realized that Israel lost the Melchezidek priesthood when Israel idolized the golden calf, and so only the Levites up until John had the Aaronic priesthood.\nSo John prepared the way, but was waiting for not only the Christ, but for the higher power and authority of God to be restored through Christ and the First Presidency of Peter, James, and John.\n\nAlways learn something new every day.\n\nI have been reading Jesus the Christ, and it is just full of knowledge waiting to be extracted and soaked in.\n\nIt is so sweet!\n\nIt is truly inspired gospel knowledge, and it is really helping me understand the Atonement better and how it applies to me.\n\nI love my Savior Jesus Christ.\n\nI have also been reading of how I can be a better missionary.\nAnd the Lord has guided me to read the great stories of Ammon, Amulek, Alma, Aaron (all start with A’s…hmm) to give me an extra motivation to do better.\nI just feel the Spirit in reading their accounts, of how their efforts led to even greater things.\nThey endured a lot, a lot of suffering and pain and imprisonment, but came out on top.\n\nI thought my life was bad.\n\nIt’d really be bad to be smitten on the cheeks and spit on by chief judges and left naked.\nWow, what great examples for me.\n\nLife is great, and tiring.\n\nWe are being blessed with some cool potential investigators and are really receiving the Lord’s blessings in this area.\nI don’t even feel like I’m working very hard, but I know I’m working smartly so I won’t burn out.\n\nI love missionary work.\n\nIn six days, my ten month mark! Oh my gosh! Time does fly!\nI’m glad to know all is well at home. Stay safe, and I love you all!\nLove,\nSpencer"

    "text": "I’m going ENGLISH!!!!\nYup, President wants me to take a break and go English. To the desert, going to be driving a Chevy truck in the middle of the desert. What luck, eh? I’m gonna be hangin’ with the Joshua trees.\nAPRIL FOOL’S!!! Yeah, I’m kidding.\nBut, I really enjoyed this week.\nNot as stressed, now I’m getting used to being senior comp and my comp L is way chill so he’s making it really easy on me.\nI get all uptight sometimes but he’s cool with it so we get along real well.\nYeah…try to have a comp who hasn’t spoken much Spanish in about 7 months and having a ton of appointments and having to speak about 90% to start off the transfer.\nRough! But, it taught me I have to help him out more.\nIt’s funny what Kristy said- > where’d all the money go?\nWell, bought photos and a 100 buck bike.\nYup, that’s about it. At least I don’t waste money asking the parents to send stuff every week. :-) Oh yeah, Uncle David sent me 100 bucks too. How nice!\nNew investigators are falling into our laps, literally.\nBecause we took over the bike area (other elders didn’t work at all) we got new referrals.\nTechnically we got 2 new investigators but we have at least 3 others that we’ll have appointments with this coming week.\nSo the work is picking back up, and everything is calming down for me. I’m not all over my head now so…it’s all good now.\nI’m so glad that President blessed me with Elder L, because if I had a pushy comp I really would be going nuts.\nHis Spanish is coming, so I’m really glad of his progress and now he’s really getting his confidence up (which helps a lot in teaching lessons).\nI used to teach the entire lesson because he wasn’t exactly confident, but now he chips in once in a while and I’m turning more and more over to him.\nI’ll have to let him teach more now we hit the 3 week mark together.\n\nWell, no one is really progressing, with the exception of a few. The Js didn’t come to church because the father was working (that sabbath day thing doesn’t click just yet nor does the application of faith) and the mother was really sick.\nShe answered the phone and I thought it was the father.\nI was like huh? who? oh…sorry…hope you feel better. A bit awkward at first. Alex G came to church with his wife (a member), as did a friend of a member whose name is Johnny M.\nHe’s progressing, he’s come to church two weeks in a row and we finally got an appointment with him.\nHe asked to get baptized, but I said just a little more preparation and you’ll be good.\nHe’s way excited! And, the non-member wife of a member has come to church for the last month, she even came without her husband yesterday!\nAfter the baptism, we finally found an investigator!\nShe used to have a baptismal date, but went to Mexico and lost her testimony.\nNow she’s asking, ‘which church is true?’ yet again. All the work that the other elders put in, lost.\nWe gotta start from ground zero again…man…why did she go to Mexico for two months?\nRight before baptism?\nWell, she’s a really good friend with a local member so we’ll see what happens. I’m afraid it’ll take a while until she gets her testimony back.\nIt’s sad to see that…Well, being senior comp means a lot of phone calls and appointments set, but I’m handing that over slowly to Elder L so I don’t have too much to do.\nThe sister missionaries had a baptism yesterday, so it was a good day overall.\nWe did some service this past week, more than usual.\nOn Tuesday we helped the amazing Sister F with weeds (she needs a lot of help in that department) and the next day we helped another elderly member pull weeds.\nIt was weird because we got their in street clothes ready to dig in and the sister missionaries were there in proselyting attire.\nWe were like…uh…Sister C? Hermanas? So they helped us weed too. It got hot too, that’s what you get when you weed in the afternoon.\n\nIt’s all good!\n\nWe had some really great and spiritual lessons this past week.\nThe Cs, just money in the spiritual department.\nThey always testify of how they’ve changed, how great they feel and that inner peace that they have.\nAnd, we found out last week that Alberto’s brother wants to start listening to us. We’re already teaching Gustavo, Alberto’s other younger brother.\nSweet!\nSo we taught the third lesson, the Gospel of Jesus Christ (faith, repentance, the whole she-bang).\nThe first time, we tried to just go through it to finish it all. But, the Spirit was strong and they kept on saying of how the Gospel has changed them…it was beautiful!\nFaith, repentance, baptism.\nThey said they really felt great after baptism and that they are really happy where they are.\n\nYadira mentioned how her faith has increased since their children, Adalay and Jeffrey, always say ‘let’s pray’ when they have a problem.\nThey were running out of gas, ‘let’s pray mommy!’.\nShe said it was great to see their faith, even as little children.\n\nThat was sweet.\n\nThe next lesson was probably better.\nThey asked us how they can tell people that they need the gift of the Holy Ghost, and thank goodness for personal study!\nI studied the Holy Ghost and how to describe it that morning, so I just whipped out some scriptures that illustrates the importance of it.\nBoth were in the book of Acts (a really great book by the way) and they were happy to find evidence in the Bible to convince their Christian friends.\nThese scriptures helped them understand the importance better, how Paul went preaching and found some disciples that were baptized after the manner of John, but needed the gift of the Holy Ghost (which Paul gave them after they were baptized in the name of Christ) which is found in Acts 19.\nAnd, about the magician Simon asking for money for the gift of the Holy Ghost (Acts 8).\nIt was awesome!\n\nI just love them!\n\nThey know the path will be hard, but they said they’re preparing for it. I can only hope that I’ll see them sealed in the temple this coming year…\n\nI’m so excited!\n\nOur investigator Alex took us out to eat lunch at a local Mexican joint in Saugus.\nWe had a great time with them.\nWe joked around, and I think he’s opening up to us more and more.\nWe’re his friends now, and his teachers.\nAs usual, he made fun of me being Asian (actually they say I’m Chinese) and it was pretty funny for him. It’s kinda getting old now…but whatever makes people happy, right? Even my comp Elder L says it’s getting old after 3 weeks of hearing it.\nWe had the longest zone conference ever on Friday. 6 hours. Pure role-play.\nI learned some things, especially how to get members comfortable in asking neighbors to listen to the missionaries.\nNow I have an idea of how to get members involved, little by little.\nI think it’ll really help this area, if I put it into practice.\nAnd I felt embarrassed when Sister Goodrich called us out to teach in a role-play about how to really describe the Holy Ghost. I was baffled, as was Elder L, because I tried to play it off a scripture and it didn’t work.\nIt was a good learning experience, and that’s why the next personal study I studied the Holy Ghost.\nI have to admit, little children have the hardest and deepest questions ever.\nOur recent convert Lesley gave us a headache in our last lesson this past week, with all her questions.\nShe asked us,\n\nwho does God pray to?  Does he need to pray?\n\nI was like…uh…companion, do you want to answer that? I gave a neutral answer that didn’t satisfy me. I really don’t know. I just assume that he prays to his father, to his father…etc.\nBut I didn’t want to get into it too deep. So it was like ‘well we don’t know’. At least we’re honest.\nWow. She’s loving church though, so that’s good!\n\nLife is great! The work is progressing!\n\nRough…and I’m happy knowing that the Cs are baptized.\nMore and more I feel that the Js will need more time…more time than I can really tell.\nBut they will be, it depends when they decide that Sunday is the Sabbath, that the Lord will provide blessings, and if they really want to learn more and progress by staying for all classes on Sundays.\nIt’s their decision, I’ve done almost all that I can.\nI love you all! I’m glad you are all safe!\nLove,\nElder Spencer Irvine"

    "text": "Dear Family:\nTruman G. Madsen has written some sweet books, from what I can tell.\nThat is really great to hear someone with a strong testimony share their personal witness of our Lord Jesus Christ.\nLucky!\nAbout the call, I’m broke right now because I got no card nor money…to get photos and stuff that I’ll need a little later on.\nOh well, I’ll wait for next week.\n\nThank you so much for the Easter package,\nI got it on Thursday I think.\nI didn’t even know when Easter was when we made our plans this week, until about Wednesday I didn’t even know it was that close.\nIt was pretty good, but the work has been a bit slow this week.\nBut, it’s going to get better.\n15 months until I get to snowboard…ahhhhh….and the sun is coming out.\nGreat weather.\n\nSo I’ve been stressed out a lot as of late because I’m the senior companion and my new comp is still learning Spanish. Not his fault, it’s just that it puts a lot of pressure on me to teach and to listen and then teach for understanding.\nEvery night I’ve gotten home, planned for the next day, and just got ready for bed.\nI’ve had no energy lately to do anything.\nIt just takes so much out of me to be the senior comp and in Spanish work.\nBut, it’s getting better since my comp is slowly learning and catching up to speed in Spanish.\nI really took my skills in Spanish for granted.\nAnd my two native comps and Elder H who was at the end of his mission.\nYup, so I’ve just been exhausted.\n\nSuch is the work!\n\nAnd I kinda let my concerns fly with some really cool elders in my zone the other day and they suggested a few things to help me cope with the new responsibilities.\n\nBut, it’s really rough.\n\nThis week went pretty well, I guess you could say.\nOur best lesson by far was with the new recent converts, the Cs.\nTuesday we had the bright idea to watch The Testaments movie with them, and we did.\nThey love movies, they have a room full of them!\nIt reminds me of back home a little.\nSo we watched it, and at the end we couldn’t say anything.\nThe Spirit was there, and they were both crying.\nElder L just quipped,\n\n‘well, there’s not words that can describe this right now’\n\nand we prayed and left them pondering and feeling the Spirit.\n\nIt was pretty sweet.\n\n\nBut, we did get a surprise call from President Goodrich wondering if he could accompany us to our appointments on Friday night.\nI was super nervous! I really like President Goodrich and all, but I was really nervous!\nSo we taught Alberto C’s brother Gustavo and his girlfriend Berenice, with both Alberto and Yadira there.\nAnd President.\n\nTalk about a lesson with the best testimonies ever!\n\nIt went really well, just talking about the commandments of the Lord and it really was a good lesson.\nThank goodness President was there because Yadira basically called Gustavo to repentance without giving him much room to say anything else.\nShe was like, ‘well, we were married because we were previously living in sin’ and ‘you have a family now, with a little baby and the best thing to do is to get married’.\nSo basically she was very blunt.\nOne of the only times I’ve heard her be so blunt and I was taken aback.\nSo President just cooled them off with, ‘ain’t the baby just so precious’ sorta attitude and it really helped.\nGustavo told us\n\n‘in 20 days I’ll let you know’.\n\nSo we got a goal now for marriage.\n\nElder L froze because President was there, so I was on my own the entire lesson. But, I also froze sometimes because President was there. But, it ended up well enough.\n\nIt was good though.\n\n\nTo be honest, Saturday really stunk.\nI’ve had a few rough days in the mission field, and this is one of them. We had all our appointments set up in Saugus (15 minutes away from the house) so we figured to knock some doors over there too.\nWe found out that all our appointments fell through, and so it’d be a waste of time to just go home, put more study time in (we left during study time so we could make it on time) and come back.\nSo, we stayed at the other elder’s apartment over in Saugus and just rested.\nElder L had to call President and his other comp up in Bishop because some members were spreading some false rumors about missionaries up there, so he did that while I relaxed in their apartment.\nWent to knock some doors, with mixed success because the layout of the apartments made it hard for us to distinguish which ones were duplex’s or a 4 apartment complex…it was the weirdest thing I’ve seen!\nSo we knocked, then went and ate lunch at the elder’s pad again.\nThen, off to visit some members around Saugus and back home.\nIt was really a rough day, no one was home too because it was Easter weekend.\nBut, we got a few lessons with a local member and another less active (who fed us dinner before we had our actual dinner appointment- I was so full!).\nIt was a really rough day. I felt tired and overwhelmed, but that’s how the work is supposed to be, right?\n\nMy comp is way cool, and he can deal with my stressed self really well.\nI’m learning to take it a bit easier now, and he’s a reason for it.\nI was wound up really tight for the past few months, and it really showed this transfer so far.\n\nHe’s so cool!\n\nWe get along really well, and he’s really humble about his Spanish abilities.\nHe’s too shy sometimes to speak, but then again I don’t want to be anal and push him way too much at one time.\nSo I’m going slow with him, and he’ll learn step by step. He’s a way chill elder. I’m so lucky to be here with him as my comp. It’s gonna be a blast this transfer!\n\nI’ve been really thinking about this transfer.\n\nI want to work hard\n\nI want to be obedient, but not robotic. It’s a really delicate balance, and I am doing my best to find the balance.\n\nIt’s tougher than expected.\n\nAnd talking over everything with the other elders in Saugus made me realize how stressful Spanish work can be.\nOther elders were called Spanish but gave up after 3 months and are stuck in English for the rest of the mission.\nI might ask President to give me a breather in English, because I’m really stressing out a lot and I don’t want to breakdown in the field.\nBut, we’ll give it another 4 weeks and see what happens.\nAnd it doesn’t make it easy trying to gauge whether President should keep 4 missionaries or put in 2 more next transfer, and I have to gauge it for him.\nIt’s a learning experience for me, no doubt.\nBut I have really seen the blessings come,\n\nI just have to be patient, remember what I have, and move on.\n\nIt’s a great experience though, and I just have to hold on and go forth.\nWe got a few more investigators this past week, and we could be having a bunch of success coming up in a few months.\nMembers trust us even more with the two apostates gone and so we got some referrals from them.\nThe members are slowly getting a bit better, and the greatest news is that we finally have a complete elder’s quorum presidency!\nNow to get the home/visiting teaching done.\n\nI’m a bit optimistic about these coming few weeks, but I can’t get my hopes up too high can I?\n\n\nThe work is going well, it’s just this past week that people have been busy with Easter stuff and the both of us have been exhausted.\nBut, we’re both adjusting to our new roles.\n\nIt’s sweet.\n\nI love you all, and I wish you all well. And I’m sorry Mom missed my emergency calls. Well, there’s…Mother’s Day!\nLove,\nElder Spencer Irvine"

    "text": "Querida Familia Irvine:\nAs for the overcoat, depends on how much it costs to send the coat.\nIf it’s a lot, I’ll just endure the cold because it’s not worth a fortune.\nAnd, P-days are too short to get everything done including shopping for coats.\nAs for packages, it’d be great!\nTalks on CDs, music, and whatever you feel like sending.\nI still haven’t finished the food you sent me way back when, like the instant rice and stuff since the members feed us A LOT!\nPlease don’t send me too much this time!\n\nPres. Goodrich probably said I’ll stay with my comp, who is amazing.\nI’m excited.\nStart the week off great, I love my investigators and I love teaching them with the Spirit.\nWe doubled attendance this week because Elder N and I visited almost every single person in the chapel yesterday.\nSaturday was, by far, the best day even though it was the busiest ever!\nWe ended up going to a less active’s house, the Ss, whose Christian daughter called us blasphemers not too long ago.\nI didn’t want to go, but Elder N was like ‘c’mon Elder Irvine’ so we did.\nWe get there and knock on the door, the daughter opens the door and had us come in.\nWe found out that her mom, the member, nearly died half and hour ago with severe drops in sugar level.\nAnd, her mom prayed for the missionaries to come.\nHer daughter knew it was an answer to her mother’s prayer.\nWe helped her move some things around the home, and sat down to talk.\nThey gave us tamales and then, the bombshell.\nThe daughter said that her trials are overwhelming, and that she wants to read the Bible and gain comfort from it.\nShe asked us gasp to teach her from the scriptures.\n\nWhat a change!\n\nThe first time I went there I nearly cried because she called us blasphemers, and now she wants us to teach her? Wow!\nSo that was a pleasant surprise (understatement).\n\n\nWe went to another investigator’s home, not home, so we went to give a blessing to a member in Canyon Country and took a 15 minute nap.\nIt was good, because we needed it later.\nZipped in, blessed her son with a blessing of comfort.\nThe mother is a perfectionist, poor kid, she was mad he wasn’t being the #1 student and was just being pretty mean in my opinion.\n\nSo we zipped over to another member, who is really sick.\nWe gave her a blessing and left to find a referral.\nWe got lost a bit, and finally found it. Not home.\nAlong the way, we stopped the car when we saw two black hoodlums walking.\nWe asked them directions,\n\n‘Hey, do you know where West Ness is?’\n\nAnd the kid closest to us shook and freaked out.\nThen they said,\n\n‘Naw, man’\n\nAnd we finally found it.\nIt was hilarious! If you saw his reaction, oh my goodness! That made my day.\n\nQuick lunch then off to contact in the park IN THE COLD. It was at least 40 plus wind chill.\nBut, we found an elect family.\nThis entire week, we’ve had some trouble finding the elect.\nWe set an hour apart in a specific place to find an elect, and we finally got one on Saturday!\nWe’re going to teach them in the next few days.\n\nFrozen, but excited, we found another recent convert and cleared up some of his doubts about priesthood, then finally went back to Newhall, 30 minutes away.\nLess active wasn’t home, so we went to eat dinner…which was just fantastic!\nEating dinner at the Us is like going to a buffett, he gives us a LOT of food!\nAnd, he’s an RM so he knows what’s up with the ward.\nHe’s our ear, our inside man.\nWe finished the ward mission plan on his comp and gave it to him.\n\n\nWe got to the Js home 30 minutes late, but our member fellowshippers were there!\nI love familia C! We taught and testified about the Holy Ghost, and the Spirit was strong.\nWe got home, planned, and crashed really fast.\nI have never been so tired than I was Saturday.\nAnd guess what, the mother, daughter, and son came to church yesterday!\nThe oldest son is in Mexico with the soccer team and the dad was busy.\nBut, they are progressing! I was so happy to see them yesterday.\n\nThe Lord is blessing us with the elect, two days in a row, and we are still going to go out there and do His work. Regardless of what happens,\nI’m going to be His representative and going to do His work and His will.\nSomething my comp pointed out to me was that we are literally God’s representatives, that people reject us, they reject God.\nWe can’t disobey the rules, because we are in His stead.\nIt’s as if we are Him when we are in the mission field.\nIt’s motivated me to be a better missionary, to actually make good contacts, teaching moments, whatever you call them, on the streets.\nMy brothers and sisters are waiting for this Gospel, I just have to testify and teach.\nWhat a great message, what a marvelous work!\nI am sad to say, I am hitting my 6 month mark.\nI am sad, I don’t want time to fly so fast!\nI want to go back to the beginning and do it over again!\nI don’t want to look back and say…if I only had done this…or that…if I only had the knowledge I have now.\n\nI love this mission, I love this work, I, most of all, love my Savior Jesus Christ.\n\nHe has blessed me with the gift of tongues, He has picked me up from the lowest points of the mission so far, and He has blessed me immensely.\nHow I love my Lord, my God! As Alma says, if I were an angel of God and go about with the trump of God!\n\nDad- I love you, my loving and righteous father. If only I could make you more proud, if only I could show you how much I miss you. Thank you for working hard, thank you for being who you are.\nMom- I love you, my exemplary mother and caregiver. I can’t say how much I appreciate your words, your packages, and most of all, your love. I miss you.\nSteven- Don’t miss church! I love you, my caring, loving, loyal, and most of all, worthy brother. You are my brother, and I know that you are the best brother I could ever have. I love you, and keep up the good work.\nGrandma- I love you, my always polite, courteous, humble, and unique grandmother. I hope that all is well, that you love your Japanese DVDs, and that you can look forward to my phone call soon. Only less than a month to go!\nKristy- I love you, just keep it up! It’s hard enough contacting for 3-4 hours, but the work will progress. I thought Spanish work is easy, it isn’t at all! The investigators will love you, the Lord loves you, and will bless you. The blessings are around the corner, as my mission president said. Just be yourself. You’d probably kick all the sister missionaries’ tail out here with all that hard work you do!\nI love you all, and I’ll talk to you soon.\nLove, Elder Irvine\nP.S. If you could send my companion Elder S a Christmas card or something, he’d appreciate it so much. I know he would appreciate a card from the best family in the world! Thank you!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Dear Irvine Family:\nWell, the weather calls for rain to move in.\nSo it’s a bit misty and moist over here, and it’s a little chilly at nights again.\n\nReminds me of back home actually.\nIt is a bit strange for me, but it’s California!\n\nI hope you all had a great President’s Day, because it was a pretty chill p-day.\nWent to a member’s house to throw a birthday party for one of the elders in the zone and then off to play some basketball in the afternoon.\nI really need to scale my basketball intensity back because my back hurts a bit after a good and hard game of basketball.\nI’m getting better at shooting (finally!) but it’s not really good overall to have a sore back for the rest of the day and a bit the next morning.\nThank you for your package, I love the Field’s goodies!\nAs for pictures, I’m saving them up to put on a CD to send to you, because if I send a memory card they’ll get erased.\n\nBut, I had my first baptism!\n\nIt was a crazy day and apparently that’s how most baptism days go.\nWe got the baptism all planned out on Tuesday and used a member’s computer on Saturday to type the program up.\nIt was a bit hectic when we had to use the computer in the clerk’s office after church to print copies of the program.\nRushed to drop the other elders off then off to fill up the baptismal font then off to a lunch appointment then back to get the other elders to get them to the baptism and got there about 20 minutes before people were going to arrive.\nI was so nervous we were going to be late!\nSo I hurried up and rushed and dressed in my whites, and just waited.\nA good amount of the ward came out with less than a day’s notice (because we finalized the baptism this past week).\nI was so nervous, and it didn’t help that one of the local members asked me,\n\n‘so, are you nervous?’\n\nand I was like\n\n‘heck yes I am it’s my first baptism!’.\n\nI actually memorized the baptismal scripture in the morning (not that hard) and right before the actual getting into the font I was thinking,\n\n‘Habiendo sido comisionado…’ in my head.\n\nHermanno DLC, gave a great talk on baptism.\nThen, a spectacular talk by Hermano PP on the gift of the Holy Ghost.\nToo bad it wasn’t geared for a 10 year old girl, but I loved it.\nAnd right before the service started, my friend Elder H told me,\n\n‘don’t drop her’.\n\nHa. Just great!\nSo I walked down into the font and I just blocked everything out of my mind.\nI said the prayer then I pushed her under. I hesitated after the first push then just completely immersed her.\nI walked inside the bathroom to change, and I said a prayer thanking the Lord for His mercy to use me as His tool.\nI didn’t even know that I was going to baptize her until Friday night and I didn’t sleep well Friday or Saturday (I didn’t pay attention to the mother’s response when we were going over the program that Tuesday- so much for listening skills).\nIt was amazing!\nI just felt so great! I was really blessed that the program went really well and that I was able to baptize someone.\nI just love it.\n\nAnd something funny that happened too was that our piano player is Elder S from Seoul, Korea.\nOur ward mission leader went to tell him that he was going to start the meeting (Elder S was doing the prelude) and said\n\n‘vamos a comenzar’.\n\nFunny thing is, Elder S only knows English and Korean. He was like, ‘huh, what?’\nThen my pal Elder H flew in and told Elder S that meant, we’re going to start.\nIt was funny for me.\nI absolutely loved it, and I can’t wait to see if the Lord will bless me with more baptisms in the mission I am serving for him.\nAnd yes, I did give her the necklace.\n\nThese last few weeks have been depressing.\nI didn’t have the Spirit with me much, because of my own faults and weaknesses and not being exactly obedient or hopeful in receiving blessings.\nA bit pessimistic and human, you could say.\nBut, I have gotten back on track.\nIt’s really rough because the other pair of elders that I room with are not very obedient and play music that doesn’t invite the Spirit, they’re pretty irreverent, and it really hurt me spiritually.\nIt was a bit rough, and I do not look forward to having an apostate companion because it might just make me want to go home.\nI was a little depressed these past weeks because of the environment that I’m in.\nOn top of that, my comp is a bit trunky, well he’s trunky so he could listen to whatever music and to some small extent date girls, but he’s still working so it’s good.\nHe’ll end his mission working, no doubt.\nSo a combination of things have been happening, but have only taught me to be patient, longsuffering, and kind.\nNot exactly me, but the Lord is teaching me in a hard way. And I felt my language suffer a bit since the Spirit wasn’t really with me, but also because I was not in a great mood all the time and didn’t study as much as I should.\nIt’s been rough, but it’s getting better slowly.\nAnd, these other guys might be moved out and we might take over their area, but we’ll see what happens.\nIt just means a lot more work! Yes!\n\nThis week was hectic…if I would tell you all it’d take forever.\nBut, we had zone conference and a trip to the temple and were busy all week.\nIt was good, but it is very tiring!\nAnd I just love the temple!\nBut now we’re only going 3 times a year so it’s a bummer instead of once every 3 weeks.\nBut, it means it’s more special.\nIt should be, but now it will be even more special.\nAnd also, the wonderful Sister F had us over for dinner to wish me a happy birthday, so it was a very strange moment without my family.\nBut, I’d do anything for them!\nThey even made me a delicious strawberry and lemon-icing cake. It was so awesome! So I had a good and busy birthday!\nThe people that we’re teaching are progressing.\nAnd, the Js came for the first time in almost a month (though late and gave me a scare), and our baptism girl Lesley also came late (really giving me a scare).\nAlso, another investigator came (they weren’t even home for our last appointment with them) and a former investigator came. \nSo we had 7 investigators without really doing much.\nIt was really like a wake-up call.\nIt was as if the Lord just said to me, ’wake up, have faith, go to work.\nAnd learn from this experience.\n\nIf the elect hear His voice, they’ll come.\n\nWow. I was really pleasantly surprised.\nI am being so blessed right now…it is truly humbling.\nThe work is progressing, and I am seeing how good this area can become.\nYes, the ward has its multiple problems but it could be improved and replenished with new blood. I really would be curious to see what happens as the months roll on.\nI love you all, and keep safe.\nLove, Elder Irvine"

    "text": "Memories of Spencer\nI can’t remember how many times I came back to the apartment feeling tense or stressed because of school or work, but Spencer knew just how to get me laughing which broke the tension I was feeling.\nWhen things were getting more serious between Michelle and I, Michelle asked for some time to consider the next step in our relationship…\nThat was the longest day and a half in my life! \nSpencer, realizing that something was up,asked how things were.  He never pressured me to share details of what was going on, but just listened. \nI asked him for a blessing and he gave me a wonderful blessing that brought me comfort and peace.  That’s when I realized what a true friend Spencer was to me.\nShortly after this, Spencer helped me set up a scavenger hunt for me to be able to propose to Michelle.  He sat next to the BYU duck pond, waiting for Michelle to covertly make an “exchange” of briefcases as he read a newspaper.  Then he rushed multiple additional clues to significant locations for Michelle and I.  He was an incredible friend and sacrificed so much!\nWhile on multiple trips to do some work training in the Maryland/DC.  Spencer was excited and always willing to meet up at Chili’s or Buffalo Wild Wings to just hang out and chat.  Was so nice to see a friendly face so far away from home!\nOn Halloween, Spencer dressed up as a mime and despite our many efforts to get him to break character and talk, he never did once… although we did get him to laugh once or twice."

    "text": "All cultures celebrate and give thanks during the harvest season.\nThe Wikipedia defines a Harvest Celebration as\nFor many in the northern Asia, the Harvest Festival is celebrated during the 8th Lunar Month, when the moon is full1.\nFor Koreans, of my generation, 추석(秋夕, Autumn Evening), or 한가위(the great middle (of autumn)) is a time of gathering, celebrating, remembering of ancestors.\nThe gathering is according to family units at the hometown for at least 3 days.\nIt is time of great feast, fresh harvest along with items normally set aside for special occasions.\nIt is a celebration if the harvest was sufficient to last the winter months, or when the next harvest can be expected – at least during the agrarian days.\nRemembering the ancestors involves tidying up the grave and preparing a meal for the deceased and saying set phrases executing set movements.\nNormally, it is a time of anticipation and celebration, unless the person is one of over 8 million2 실향민 in South Korea.\n실향민(失鄕民 / refugee), is also translated a Displace People. People who are unable to return to their homeland due to, usually, man-made, political boundaries.\nGrowing up, gathering during the Harvest Celebration, meant visiting the graves of the deceased and visiting the household with the oldest member of the clan.\nSince my family migrated (or were refugees) from Northern part of Korea, the gathering was very small, the celebration was limited. We talked of old home (老家) and we yearned for the day when we can travel to the ancestral home and meet the people with common heritage.\nThat dream is still is alive.\nHowever the probability of its occurrence is small. Even it was possible, what is the meaning of face to face meeting people with no interactions or knowledge of relationship – for nearly 75 years.\nCelebrating harvest celebration alone as a grown up was more challenging. Everyone took the, mandatory time off and headed to their hometown.\nI, on the other hand, went and visited my only relative in Seoul – traveling in opposite direction than the vast majority of the population.\nLiving in the United States has been a dream of my parents. Most of the time, I relish the label of refugee/immigrant. A refugee within Korea followed by migration to the great land of America.\nAt times, especially during the time of family gathering to ancestral home, I wish to know the rest of people that I ought to know."

    "text": "Merging onto the University Avenue from the 2230 North can seem like a driving in a blend line in a race track, joining the race from the pit lane (2230 N) to race track (Univ. Ave).1\nThe pace and drama depends on the car one is driving and the horsepower or more accurately, the acceleration of the car.\nOne constant is the view of Timpanogos.\n\n\nOn this day, returning to office, after an extended holiday time off, was feeling nostalgic in the Subaru that has been in the family since the beginning of this century.\nThe nostalgia due to its array of CD Changer, a cassette player, and a FM receiver with 12 preset stations.\nUtah Valley has an abundance of FM station that perfectly serves those of us that experienced the latter half of the past century.\nThere is Classical 89 that has morning, afternoon and evening hosts. (89.1 or 89.5 MHz in Provo/Orem Area)\nThe one that plays soft hits from decades in 1900s. Classy FM. (99.1 MHz in Provo/Orem Area)\nThen the new station, that used to call itself GOAT-FM, is now Flashback 96.7 (MHz)\n\nWith the view of Timpanogos fading, the cars transitioned into another blend line (800 North in Orem), after showing off cars agility.\nThe Flashback FM played a melody that foreshadowed a great song.\nAfter an intro that lasted nearly a minute, singers harmonized then the lead singer began.\nRecognized the singer right away but I had not heard this song and almost forgotten it existed.\n\n\nAt the office, tried to look up the song using some of the lines from the song.\nTook a while, thanks to algorithms, the song was found.\nSome would classify this as a Rhythm and Blues, Soul, Funk or even Disco.\nBut great songs defy classification and create its own class.\nThis should be classified as Songs about Life\nLink to Love I Lost\n\nOne level, the song captures the pains of separation with words and music.\nTeddy Pendergrass is an unique, generational talent.\nBackground singers, the arrangement and mastering. A perfect blend, a music from a bygone era.\n\nAt another level, the song invokes memories of something lost (faded away) or given up as one ages.\nAt times, life takes (and we follow) a direction not anticipated and not appreciated.\nIt would be helpful and assuring to find a reason that explains why certain events occur. Why certain people appear and are separated from us.\n\n\nUntil those questions are answered, the life and its meaning seem distant and not applicable.\nBut in someways we find comfort and meaning in having had the chance to experience all facets of this life, form relationships, moreover create memories that will outlive this temporal existence.\nAnd occasionally, a song that triggers memory of life in simpler days.\nAppreciate the FM Technology, and those stations that stream, the old fashioned way.\nThank you Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff for writing the song. Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes for recording the song. Musicians and technicians for preserving this piece.2\nKenny and Leon,\nWould it be OK if we changed the wording slightly.\n\nThe Love We Remember The Faith That Guided Them Those Memories We Cherish\nWe will never let go\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_motorsport_terms↩︎\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Love_I_Lost↩︎"
