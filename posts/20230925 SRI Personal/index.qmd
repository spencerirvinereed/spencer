Our beloved husband, son, brother, and uncle Spencer Reed Irvine, passed away peacefully on the evening of 24 September 2023 in Scottsdale, Arizona after a courageous bout with cancer.

Spencer was born on February 13, 1988 in Rockville, Maryland.

He excelled in all areas of endeavors in life, yet he was humble and a friend to all.\
He embodied a gentle kindness to all and was a source of many excellent conversations.

He graduated from Brigham Young University, with an International Relations degree.\
He obtained a Master of Public Administration from George Washington University.\
He served in the California San Fernando Mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

His hobbies and enjoyment included history, sport analytics, writing in areas of policies and politics, these shaped his life.

His talent for writing came from an accurate assessment of himself, grounded in his faith in Jesus Christ, and his surroundings.

Often drawing and building upon an initial assessment then rigorously testing his thesis and rewriting as many times as necessary to satisfy his high standard.

Perhaps he gained this skill through his father, Don, and also his grandfather Reed.\
Both of whom adored Spencer and influenced his outlook and shaped his core.

From his mother, Young Kang Irvine, Spencer learned hard work and perseverance -- a first generation Korean immigrant.

Spencer had great interest in the service of Grandpa Kang in the Korean War and had researched into the battles that Grandpa was involved in.

Whether the setting was academic, religion, or work, Spencer applied all his faculties and energy.

And most responded because they all felt his sincerity and love, which Spencer was blessed with in abundance.

Many select and establish their North Star and an internal compass, and means to reckon and keep track of passage of time to guide their journey in this life.

Spencer was gifted with an absolute and abiding True North and built himself a never deviating compass, and fashioned a perpetual time keeping method -- all based on his faith in Jesus Christ, an understanding of the Will of the Father, and immense love for his fellow travelers.

He knew the purpose of this life, to love others as they need to be loved, without pre-condition or judgment.

Forever grateful that we got to know him and feel his love, taking a part in this journey together.

We have lost a guide, and the pain persists.

He was a leader that showed how to comfort and heal one another.

Spencer is survived by his love of life Meg Nu√±ez Irvine, loving parents Don and Young, siblings Kristy (Tyler) and Steven (Bree).

The funeral services will be held on Saturday, September 30, 2023, 10AM.\
(Viewing will be from 9AM to 9:45AM)
