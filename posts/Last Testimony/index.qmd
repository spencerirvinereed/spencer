The Lord will never lead us astray and He is always with us.

He has been with me during my trial and diagnosis of cancer.

And I know He will not abandon me.

He has shown me tender mercies with messages from friends of years past.

I have heard from people whom I love and respect as a youth and as an adult.\
I have felt my Savior's love.\
I know He is real.

He exists.

And I know He loves me.

He is Jesus the Christ.

He is my loving Lord and Savior, even Redeemer of all mankind.

I look to Him and I shall live again. I know Him. I love Him.

In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, I testify of Him and pray. Amen.
