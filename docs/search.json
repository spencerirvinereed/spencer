    "text": "Our beloved husband, son, brother, and uncle Spencer Reed Irvine, passed away peacefully on the evening of 24 September 2023 in Scottsdale, Arizona after a courageous bout with cancer.\nSpencer was born on February 13, 1988 in Rockville, Maryland.\nHe excelled in all areas of endeavors in life, yet he was humble and a friend to all.\nHe embodied a gentle kindness to all and was a source of many excellent conversations.\nHe graduated from Brigham Young University, with an International Relations degree.\nHe obtained a Master of Public Administration from George Washington University.\nHe served in the California San Fernando Mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nHis hobbies and enjoyment included history, sport analytics, writing in areas of policies and politics, these shaped his life.\nHis talent for writing came from an accurate assessment of himself, grounded in his faith in Jesus Christ, and his surroundings.\nOften drawing and building upon an initial assessment then rigorously testing his thesis and rewriting as many times as necessary to satisfy his high standard.\nPerhaps he gained this skill through his father, Don, and also his grandfather Reed.\nBoth of whom adored Spencer and influenced his outlook and shaped his core.\nFrom his mother, Young Kang Irvine, Spencer learned hard work and perseverance – a first generation Korean immigrant.\nSpencer had great interest in the service of Grandpa Kang in the Korean War and had researched into the battles that Grandpa was involved in.\nWhether the setting was academic, religion, or work, Spencer applied all his faculties and energy.\nAnd most responded because they all felt his sincerity and love, which Spencer was blessed with in abundance.\n\nMany select and establish their North Star and an internal compass, and means to reckon and keep track of passage of time to guide their journey in this life.\nSpencer was gifted with an absolute and abiding True North and built himself a never deviating compass, and fashioned a perpetual time keeping method – all based on his faith in Jesus Christ, an understanding of the Will of the Father, and immense love for his fellow travelers.\nHe knew the purpose of this life, to love others as they need to be loved, without pre-condition or judgment.\nForever grateful that we got to know him and feel his love, taking a part in this journey together.\nWe have lost a guide, and the pain persists.\nHe was a leader that showed how to comfort and heal one another.\nSpencer is survived by his love of life Meg Nuñez Irvine, loving parents Don and Young, siblings Kristy (Tyler) and Steven (Bree).\nThe funeral services will be held on Saturday, September 30, 2023, 10AM.\n(Viewing will be from 9AM to 9:45AM)\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at 3920 N 44th Pl, Phoenix, AZ 85018.

    "text": "This area needs a lot of improvement, so that’s why I’m here I guess.\nIt’s so amazing though! Much prettier than the San Fernando Valley for sure.\nWhen I got to the area the first week, Elder N told me that he asked mission president to send him one of the hardest working missionaries that he has.\nI was touched to hear that from Elder N, because before I came here I had some doubts about my abilities, my purpose, if I was doing something wrong…but I’m very excited to be here now!\nThe investigators here are almost (casi) golden!\nJust a few commitments that they have to keep, but we’re working on them.\nOne family, the Js, are super golden!\nThe father can’t read, so we gave him Book of Mormon CDs so he can listen to them.\nBut, his family reads the Book of Mormon. I love them so much!\nWe have a great fellowshipping couple, the Cs (literally means eyebrow), and they bring the Spirit with them.\nHermano J said that\n\nhe feels something different when we’re here, that when the missionaries come there is peace and joy in their home.\n\n\nTears welled up in my eyes and I was overwhelmed by the Spirit. Hermana J cried a little too, I could see her wipe away some tears at the end.\nElder N then testified that it was the Holy Ghost that was with us, and that it is testifying to them that what we teach is from God.\nThey have the best potential out of all of our investigators.\nBefore I came here, we had 5 investigators in Arleta.\nNow, we have about 3 possibly golden, and a lot of potentials and ‘alright’ investigators.\nReflecting and talking about my previous area with my new comp makes me realize that I still have a lot to work on to receive these blessings.\nAnother family, the Ms, are amazing! They have a lot to learn, but they are looking for the truth.\nThey studied with the Jehovah’s Witnesses for a long time, but they stopped hearing them to hear us.\nThey had some deep questions, like is Jesus Christ Jehovah?\nSo we’re adjusting our lessons to ask them to believe on faith that what we teach is of God.\nThey’ve studied the Bible, and they know a good amount in my opinion.\nThe bishop is helping us out along with his wife, that was pretty sweet when they came and testified of what we taught.\nBut, Bishop A has a lot to learn still, he’s still learning the ropes of being bishop.\nThe second counselor is an RM, and he’s an excellent member.\nMarried, has two girls, and has a solid testimony. Hermano U is excited about missionary work, because he’s seen how important it is to the church’s progress in this ward.\nWe noticed that the bishop focuses on less actives, so we’re going to make an outline of what a ward mission plan should be then give it to Hermano U to submit to the bishopric.\nHe has had some great experiences in the mission field!\nWe have a potential, whose life has fallen apart.\nHis wife left him, he has two children, his oldest (son) is on drugs, his youngest has no one to take care for her except her mother, he is alone!\nI know I’m here for a reason, to bring these ‘great news’, that what Gospel means literally, to him and to other people like him!\n\nOh, how I love the mission!\n\n\nOur ward needs a ton of help.\nThe records haven’t been updated, so we have a lot of people (apparently, by word of Hermano U) that have moved.\nDoesn’t help the person in charge of it is semi-inactive (the Js) and apparently feels excluded by Latinos because he (the husband) is American and his wife is Dominican. Argh!\nBut, we do have a lot of RM’s. But, we don’t have the support of the priesthood at all.\nWe prepare the Sacrament, we bless the Sacrament, we teach Gospel Doctrine sometimes, the sisters teach Primary…we do almost everything!\nI thought that was only in South America! But, we can see that the work needs to progress, they’re people here ready to hear us!\nJust get to work…and it’s going to be slow, but it’ll work out in the end.\nI know it will, as long as the Spirit will lift us and strengthen us.\nYesterday, it was a great sacrament meeting.\nAll six of us missionaries bore our testimonies along with our spiritual conversion story.\nWe all went up, and it was great to see the happiness in the expressions of the members.\nI have been blessed with the gift of tongues.\nIt says so in my patriarchial blessing, and I know that when I speak, the Lord is guiding me to say what I need to say.\nIt’s hard to keep the language up sometimes since my comp likes to us English (but we can converse normally in Spanish) but not as much as Sandoval liked to us English.\nI feel my learning is expanding now.\nIt’s just I have to make language study a priority or my comp will schedule appointments during language study time. Never a good thing.\nAfter I bore my testimony, and how I knew this Church is of God, the members thanked us all for our testimonies.\nThey felt the Spirit.\nAnd, everyone was impressed by my Spanish.\nTo which I always say, I studied for 7 years before, the Lord is blessing me, I love being here.\nIt’s hard to not compare oneself to others, and I’m working on that.\nAt times I can get a big head, but I remember that this is the Lord’s work and I’m only an instrument.\nJust imagine, natives love my Spanish and I only have 3 months in the field…the Lord’s hand is in my life.\nI’ve been studying the Book of Mormon recently, and I’m impressed how faithful Nephi is to the Lord.\nNever murmured, never turned away, never asked ‘why me?’, but faithfully obeyed His will.\nNo wonder the Primary sings about him so much.\nI love one scripture, which was given in a talk by John Bytheway (great speaker by the way…haha).\n1st Nephi 11:17, when Nephi was talking to the Spirit. To paraphrase the verse, The Spirit asked what he knew about the condescension of God? To which Nephi said,\n\nI know God loves his children, but I do not know the meaning of all things.\n\nWe may never know why things are happening, but we know God loves EACH and EVERY one of us.\nWe can’t see his reasons why, but we know that God loves us.\nNo matter what happens, no matter what becomes of us, we know that there is a purpose in all the things we are going through.\nI suggest his book and/or talk, 5 Scriptures that Will Get You Through Almost Everything, or something like that. One great talk.\nI’m on the mission, being constantly tired and at times confused in my lessons, to learn.\nI’m with a veteran companion to learn how to be a leader.\nI’m in this area to teach families and bring them to Christ.\nHow can I know that I am setting these people on the path to the Celestial Kingdom?\nAs Pres. Eyring said, you know when the Spirit testifies through you in lessons, that when you love the people so much the Spirit will be brought into your lessons so strongly you can’t deny his presence.\nHow do I know?\nThe pure love of Christ and the hope that they will make it.\nIf the Spirit touches them and they are converted by the Spirit and Book of Mormon, you have done your part.\nWhat great comfort that gives me!\nHow do I know? By the Spirit. How do I know?\nIf they have a testimony of the Book of Mormon.\nI learned about the Pre-Existence two weeks ago, and I want to share some thoughts that I’ve had about it ever since.\nI’ll have to send you the scriptures, because I don’t have it with me right now.\nBut I know, after studying this topic, that we did live with God before this life. We were one of the chosen (Abraham saw it as did Joseph F. Smith in D&C 138), we were called before the foundation of this world, we were one of those who were victorious against Lucifer and his angels.\nWhat a great blessing it is to know we are special children of God, called forth to come here today, to lay the foundation of a great work.\nI know that I lived with God before.\nI progressed, but not as fast as others.\nI learned, but not as well as others.\nBut I know, I know that God lives. I know that God loves me. I know that God wants me here. I know that this work is leading so many people to Him, in His time, and I love being His instrument.\nA friend wrote me and reminded me to not be discouraged, because I am a part of this great work. I know God loves me, and every day is a testimony of His love for all his children.\nThe work is hard.\nInvestigators lie to us all the time, and we still love them.\nBut, the work will progress. I know it will. Just a little more love, a little more sacrifice, then we will receive blessings.\nMom- Thank you for your love. I love you.\nPlease, read the scriptures and bear your testimony as often as you can.\nYou will only grow in your testimony and in your gospel knowledge.\nDad- I love you. For your example, your dedication, your devotion, your faith. I hope you are proud of me, because I am proud of you.\nKristy- Keep up the good work. God loves you. God wants you to work. God wants you to keep being faithful and obedient, then the blessings will come. Numbers don’t matter, it is YOU who matters the most. I love you. I wish you the best.\nSteven- I love you, my ‘little’ but taller brother. Listen to the counsels of the apostles, prepare now! Prepare now for the mission! It is your calling! That’s why you’re here right now! If you have time, listen or read John Bytheway’s “What I Wish I Knew Before My Mission”, because I know that I wish I knew these things before I hit the MTC. Keep up the grades, keep the faith, use your priesthood worthily.\nGrandma- I love you, my beloved grandmother. Your life is full of sacrifice, and I love you for all you’ve done for me. God loves you. God wants you to be happy. This life isn’t the end of everything, it is only the beginning. I love you Grandma, and Happy Birthday!\nGosh, I wish I knew Korean! I need to learn when I get back! And, my favorite scripture is yet to be determined, I’ll get to you on that in my letter. Thanks for everything!\nI love you all, and I hope all is well in Zion!\nLove, Elder Irvine"

    "text": "Dear Family:\nI really thought that I ought to have done an April Fool’s number just to keep everyone on their toes.\nBut, I wouldn’t mind if that happens, but whatever the Lord wants.\nIt’s hard to keep working when one gets in a routine so I’ve been mixing things up a little bit to keep me balanced and not bored.\nYes, I got the traveler’s checks so I’ll cash it in soon.\nAnd I have so many pictures to send you, but I need the cord to burn it to a CD to send home.\nDon’t want a memory swipe to happen again.\nAnd that’s sweet that Steven is improving his grades - I’d love to see him out at BYU!\nIt’s the best thing to have siblings out at the same college so you’re not too lonely.\nThis weekend was edifying.\n\nI loved conference.\n\nI missed the main points of Elder Hales’ talk because I fell asleep during his talk and maybe another talk in that session.\n\nBut, it went well for me.\n\nI was really happy to hear Elder Bednar call the members out, because all the members pray for the missionaries but are really passive in helping us with better investigators than we can find their friends!\nThis conference was really great! I soaked in a lot.\n\nBednar’s was really great, Holland’s wasn’t as argumentative as his last one (I felt energized to go bash after last conference after hearing his talk), and I loved Uchtdorf’s talk in priesthood session.\nI learned so much, and the importance of prophets most of all.\nAlmost (if not) everyone mentioned they sustained the new prophet Thomas S. Monson and testified that the heavens aren’t closed.\nI really loved Holland’s talk, how he explained that if we believe in closed canon, we don’t believe God is the same as he was yesterday.\nIt was a weekend full of being edified by living scriptures. I can’t point out one that I really liked more than the rest.\nI am so grateful for a living prophet. It’s sad that people think God doesn’t talk to us anymore.\nWhen I teach, I ask people,\n\ndo you believe God is the same as he was yesterday?\n\nYes.\n\nSo do you believe that he has always called prophets?\n\nYes.\n\nSo would you think that he’d call prophets today? He’s the same, right?\n\nThey waffle on this one.\n\nDo we not need God’s help even more today?\n\nThey agree, then try to add something else. But, without a prophet, we are lost. God is really merciful with us.\n\nThis week was pretty busy, but relaxed at the end.\nA good finish.\nAt midweeks, we taught 15 lessons, probably one of the best weeks in the mission. I was really happy. We had 4 straight lessons on Tuesday, and that was really tiring!\nNo matter how hard we try to relax and regain strength each p-day (D&C 10:4 says don’t run faster than you have strength), never works.\nWe’re tired. Celestial fatigue…\nOur ‘golden’ investigator J is a bit questionable. He has quite a temper and is a bit too impatient. He’s been baptized in other churches, and I only found that out talking to his friend R (who’s a member).\nWe’re going to take our time with him, knowing he’s been baptized in several churches.\nIt ain’t a game, and I don’t believe he knows that yet.\nWe’ll see what he really feels when we take our time teaching him. But, he did come to watch conference.\nWe did have some good news with a woman we’ve been helping clean her house, P. She, at first, said she doesn’t want to hear our message, but wants us to come back and help her.\nBut, she was excited to hear General Conference, and she listened to the afternoon session on Sunday.\nSo she called us afterwards and asked many questions, which I hope I answered clearly for her understanding.\nShe said she felt great hearing their words, but they weren’t like TVN (televangelists) pastors.\nI nearly said, ‘well, we aren’t for entertaining and gaining money’.\nBut, I held my tongue because she loves watching TVN.\nShe’s progressing, slowly, but she’s opening up little by little. I feel good about her progress.\n\nA and Y are doing great!\nThey loved conference, and are just soaking everything in like a sponge. I am so happy they’re progressing a lot even after baptism.\nIt was strange because we had a lot more less active/recent convert lessons. We committed two of our less actives to meet with the bishop, and we’ll follow up on that.\nAnd our recent converts are strong as ever. It’s really too bad to know that it’s great that we do this, but this should be the job of the ward missionaries, home and visiting teachers that don’t exist right now.\nBut, the ward is working with it…we just have to be patient.\nI expressed this concern to the second counselor Hermano U, and he said it’s just a long process with this ward.\nHopefully, it’ll be done by the time I end my mission. If not…I don’t like to think about it.\nOne thing I learned from Hermano Pablo P was that the reason why John the Baptist was the Elias, was that he was waiting for the higher priesthood.\nHe told me that he realized that Israel lost the Melchezidek priesthood when Israel idolized the golden calf, and so only the Levites up until John had the Aaronic priesthood.\nSo John prepared the way, but was waiting for not only the Christ, but for the higher power and authority of God to be restored through Christ and the First Presidency of Peter, James, and John.\n\nAlways learn something new every day.\n\nI have been reading Jesus the Christ, and it is just full of knowledge waiting to be extracted and soaked in.\n\nIt is so sweet!\n\nIt is truly inspired gospel knowledge, and it is really helping me understand the Atonement better and how it applies to me.\n\nI love my Savior Jesus Christ.\n\nI have also been reading of how I can be a better missionary.\nAnd the Lord has guided me to read the great stories of Ammon, Amulek, Alma, Aaron (all start with A’s…hmm) to give me an extra motivation to do better.\nI just feel the Spirit in reading their accounts, of how their efforts led to even greater things.\nThey endured a lot, a lot of suffering and pain and imprisonment, but came out on top.\n\nI thought my life was bad.\n\nIt’d really be bad to be smitten on the cheeks and spit on by chief judges and left naked.\nWow, what great examples for me.\n\nLife is great, and tiring.\n\nWe are being blessed with some cool potential investigators and are really receiving the Lord’s blessings in this area.\nI don’t even feel like I’m working very hard, but I know I’m working smartly so I won’t burn out.\n\nI love missionary work.\n\nIn six days, my ten month mark! Oh my gosh! Time does fly!\nI’m glad to know all is well at home. Stay safe, and I love you all!\nLove,\nSpencer"

    "text": "I’m going ENGLISH!!!!\nYup, President wants me to take a break and go English. To the desert, going to be driving a Chevy truck in the middle of the desert. What luck, eh? I’m gonna be hangin’ with the Joshua trees.\nAPRIL FOOL’S!!! Yeah, I’m kidding.\nBut, I really enjoyed this week.\nNot as stressed, now I’m getting used to being senior comp and my comp L??n is way chill so he’s making it really easy on me.\nI get all uptight sometimes but he’s cool with it so we get along real well.\nYeah…try to have a comp who hasn’t spoken much Spanish in about 7 months and having a ton of appointments and having to speak about 90% to start off the transfer.\nRough! But, it taught me I have to help him out more.\nIt’s funny what Kristy said- where’d all the money go? Well, bought photos and a 100 buck bike.\nYup, that’s about it. At least I don’t waste money asking the parents to send stuff every week. :-) Oh yeah, Uncle David sent me 100 bucks too. How nice!\nNew investigators are falling into our laps, literally.\nBecause we took over the bike area (other elders didn’t work at all) we got new referrals.\nTechnically we got 2 new investigators but we have at least 3 others that we’ll have appointments with this coming week.\nSo the work is picking back up, and everything is calming down for me. I’m not all over my head now so…it’s all good now.\nI’m so glad that President blessed me with L??n, because if I had a pushy comp I really would be going nuts.\nHis Spanish is coming, so I’m really glad of his progress and now he’s really getting his confidence up (which helps a lot in teaching lessons).\nI used to teach the entire lesson because he wasn’t exactly confident, but now he chips in once in a while and I’m turning more and more over to him.\nI’ll have to let him teach more now we hit the 3 week mark together.\nWell, no one is really progressing, with the exception of a few. The J??mes didn’t come to church because the father was working (that sabbath day thing doesn’t click just yet nor does the application of faith) and the mother was really sick.\nShe answered the phone and I thought it was the father.\nI was like huh? who? oh…sorry…hope you feel better. A bit awkward at first. Alex Gon???ez came to church with his wife (a member), as did a friend of a member whose name is Johnny Mar???ez.\nHe’s progressing, he’s come to church two weeks in a row and we finally got an appointment with him.\nHe asked to get baptized, but I said just a little more preparation and you’ll be good.\nHe’s way excited! And, the non-member wife of a member has come to church for the last month, she even came without her husband yesterday!\nAfter the baptism, we finally found an investigator!\nShe used to have a baptismal date, but went to Mexico and lost her testimony.\nNow she’s asking, ‘which church is true?’ yet again. All the work that the other elders put in, lost. We gotta start from ground zero again…man…why did she go to Mexico for two months? Right before baptism? Well, she’s a really good friend with a local member so we’ll see what happens. I’m afraid it’ll take a while until she gets her testimony back.\nIt’s sad to see that…Well, being senior comp means a lot of phone calls and appointments set, but I’m handing that over slowly to L??n so I don’t have too much to do.\nThe sister missionaries had a baptism yesterday, so it was a good day overall.\nWe did some service this past week, more than usual. On Tuesday we helped the amazing Sister Flick with weeds (so lame but she needs a lot of help in that department) and the next day we helped an elderly member pull weeds. It was weird because we got their in street clothes ready to dig in and the sister missionaries were there in proselyting attire. We were like…uh…sister Carrillo? Hermanas? So they helped us weed too. It got hot too, that’s what you get when you weed in the afternoon. It’s all good!\nWe had some really great and spiritual lessons this past week. The Car???as, just money in the spiritual department. They always testify of how they’ve changed, how great they feel and that inner peace that they have. And, we found out last week that Alberto’s brother wants to start listening to us. We’re already teaching Gustavo, Alberto’s other younger brother. Sweet! So we taught the third lesson, the Gospel of Jesus Christ (faith, repentance, the whole she-bang). The first time, we tried to just go through it to finish it all. But, the Spirit was strong and they kept on saying of how the Gospel has changed them…it was beautiful! Faith, repentance, baptism. They said they really felt great after baptism and that they are really happy where they are. Yadira mentioned how her faith has increased since their children, Adalay and Jeffrey, always say ‘let’s pray’ when they have a problem. They were running out of gas, ‘let’s pray mommy!’. She said it was great to see their faith, even as little children. That was sweet. The next lesson was probably better. They asked us how they can tell people that they need the gift of the Holy Ghost, and thank goodness for personal study! I studied the Holy Ghost and how to describe it that morning, so I just whipped out some scriptures that illustrates the importance of it. Both were in the book of Acts (a really great book by the way) and they were happy to find evidence in the Bible to convince their Christian friends. These scriptures helped them understand the importance better, how Paul went preaching and found some disciples that were baptized after the manner of John, but needed the gift of the Holy Ghost (which Paul gave them after they were baptized in the name of Christ) which is found in Acts 19 (I think). And, about the magician Simon asking for money for the gift of the Holy Ghost (Acts 8). It was awesome! I just love them! They know the path will be hard, but they said they’re preparing for it. I can only hope that I’ll see them sealed in the temple this coming year…I’m so excited!\nOur investigator Alex took us out to eat lunch at a local Mexican joint in Saugus. We had a great time with them. We joked around, and I think he’s opening up to us more and more. We’re his friends now, and his teachers. As usual, he made fun of me being Asian (actually they say I’m Chinese) and it was pretty funny for him. It’s kinda getting old now…but whatever makes people happy, right? Even my comp L??n says it’s getting old after 3 weeks of hearing it.\nWe had the longest zone conference ever on Friday. 6 hours. Pure role-play. I learned some things, especially how to get members comfortable in asking neighbors to listen to the missionaries. Now I have an idea of how to get members involved, little by little. I think it’ll really help this area, if I put it into practice. And I felt embarrassed when Sister Goodrich called us out to teach in a role-play about how to really describe the Holy Ghost. I was baffled, as was L??n, because I tried to play it off a scripture and it didn’t work. It was a good learning experience, and that’s why the next personal study I studied the Holy Ghost. It was really long….gosh I don’t like role-plays that much.\nI have to admit, little children have the hardest and deepest questions ever.\nOur recent convert Lesley gave us a headache in our last lesson this past week, with all her questions.\nShe asked us,\n\nwho does God pray to?  Does he need to pray?\n\nI was like…uh…companion, do you want to answer that? I gave a neutral answer that didn’t satisfy me. I really don’t know. I just assume that he prays to his father, to his father…etc.\nBut I didn’t want to get into it too deep. So it was like ‘well we don’t know’. At least we’re honest.\nWow. She’s loving church though, so that’s good!\nLife is great! The work is progressing!\nRough…and I’m happy knowing that the Car???as are baptized.\nMore and more I feel that the Ja??es will need more time…more time than I can really tell.\nBut they will be, it depends when they decide that Sunday is the Sabbath, that the Lord will provide blessings, and if they really want to learn more and progress by staying for all classes on Sundays.\nIt’s their decision, I’ve done almost all that I can.\nI love you all! I’m glad you are all safe!\nLove,\nElder Spencer Irvine"

    "text": "Dear Family:\nTruman G. Madsen has written some sweet books, from what I can tell. That is really great to hear someone with a strong testimony share their personal witness of our Lord Jesus Christ. Lucky! About the call, I’m broke right now because I got no card nor money…to get photos and stuff that I’ll need a little later on. Oh well, I’ll wait for next week. Thank you so much for the Easter package, I got it on Thursday I think. I didn’t even know when Easter was when we made our plans this week, until about Wednesday I didn’t even know it was that close. It was pretty good, but the work has been a bit slow this week. But, it’s going to get better. 15 months until I get to snowboard…ahhhhh….and the sun is coming out. Great weather.\nSo I’ve been stressed out a lot as of late because I’m the senior companion and my new comp is still learning Spanish. Not his fault, it’s just that it puts a lot of pressure on me to teach and to listen and then teach for understanding. Every night I’ve gotten home, planned for the next day, and just got ready for bed. I’ve had no energy lately to do anything. It just takes so much out of me to be the senior comp and in Spanish work. But, it’s getting better since my comp is slowly learning and catching up to speed in Spanish. I really took my skills in Spanish for granted. And my two native comps and Hansen who was at the end of his mission. Yup, so I’ve just been exhausted. Such is the work! And I kinda let my concerns fly with some really cool elders in my zone the other day and they suggested a few things to help me cope with the new responsibilities. But, it’s really rough.\nThis week went pretty well, I guess you could say. Our best lesson by far was with the new recent converts, the Cardenas. Tuesday we had the bright idea to watch The Testaments movie with them, and we did. They love movies, they have a room full of them! It reminds me of back home a little. So we watched it, and at the end we couldn’t say anything. The Spirit was there, and they were both crying. Lynn just quipped, ‘well, there’s not words that can describe this right now’ and we prayed and left them pondering and feeling the Spirit. It was pretty sweet.\nBut, we did get a surprise call from President Goodrich wondering if he could accompany us to our appointments on Friday night. I was super nervous! I really like President Goodrich and all, but I was really nervous! So we taught Alberto Cardenas’ brother Gustavo and his girlfriend Berenice, with both Alberto and Yadira there. And President. Talk about a lesson with the best testimonies ever! It went really well, just talking about the commandments of the Lord and it really was a good lesson. Thank goodness President was there because Yadira basically called Gustavo to repentance without giving him much room to say anything else. She was like, ‘well, we were married because we were previously living in sin’ and ‘you have a family now, with a little baby and the best thing to do is to get married’. So basically she was very blunt. One of the only times I’ve heard her be so blunt and I was taken aback. So President just cooled them off with, ‘ain’t the baby just so precious’ sorta attitude and it really helped. Gustavo told us ‘in 20 days I’ll let you know’. So we got a goal now for marriage. Lynn froze because President was there, so I was on my own the entire lesson. But, I froze sometimes because President was there. But, it ended up well enough. It was good though.\nTo be honest, Saturday really stunk. I’ve had a few rough days in the mission field, and this is one of them. We had all our appointments set up in Saugus (15 minutes away from the house) so we figured to knock some doors over there too. We found out that all our appointments fell through, and so it’d be a waste of time to just go home, put more study time in (we left during study time so we could make it on time) and come back. So, we stayed at the other elder’s apartment over in Saugus and just rested. Lynn had to call President and his other comp up in Bishop because some members were spreading some false rumors about missionaries up there, so he did that while I relaxed in their apartment. Went to knock some doors, with mixed success because the layout of the apartments made it hard for us to distinguish which ones were duplex’s or a 4 apartment complex…it was the weirdest thing I’ve seen! So we knocked, then went and ate lunch at the elder’s pad again. Then, off to visit some members around Saugus and back home. It was really a rough day, no one was home too because it was Easter weekend. But, we got a few lessons with a local member and another less active (who fed us dinner before we had our actual dinner appointment- I was so full!). It was a really rough day. I felt tired and overwhelmed, but that’s how the work is supposed to be, right?\nMy comp is way cool, and he can deal with my stressed self really well. I’m learning to take it a bit easier now, and he’s a reason for it. I was wound up really tight for the past few months, and it really showed this transfer so far. He’s so cool! We get along really well, and he’s really humble about his Spanish abilities. He’s too shy sometimes to speak, but then again I don’t want to be anal and push him way too much at one time. So I’m going slow with him, and he’ll learn step by step. He’s a way chill elder. I’m so lucky to be here with him as my comp. It’s gonna be a blast this transfer!\nI’ve been really thinking about this transfer. I want to work hard, but I don’t want to die like Neira and I did. I want to be obedient, but not robotic. It’s a really delicate balance, and I am doing my best to find the balance. It’s tougher than expected. And talking over everything with the other elders in Saugus made me realize how stressful Spanish work can be. My MTC comp Wheeler apparently stressed out too much and could’ve had a breakdown at one point. Other elders were called Spanish but gave up after 3 months and are stuck in English for the rest of the mission. I might ask President to give me a breather in English, because I’m really stressing out a lot and I don’t want to breakdown in the field. But, we’ll give it another 4 weeks and see what happens. And it doesn’t make it easy trying to gauge whether President should keep 4 missionaries or put in 2 more next transfer, and I have to gauge it for him. It’s a learning experience for me, no doubt. But I have really seen the blessings come, I just have to be patient, remember what I have, and move on. It’s a great experience though, and I just have to hold on and go forth.\nWe got a few more investigators this past week, and we could be having a bunch of success coming up in a few months. Members trust us even more with the two apostates gone and so we got some referrals from them. The members are slowly getting a bit better, and the greatest news is that we finally have a complete elder’s quorum presidency! Now to get the home/visiting teaching done. I’m a bit optimistic about these coming few weeks, but I can’t get my hopes up too high can I?\nThe work is going well, it’s just this past week that people have been busy with Easter stuff and the both of us have been exhausted. But, we’re both adjusting to our new roles. It’s sweet.\nI love you all, and I wish you all well. And I’m sorry Mom missed my emergency calls. Well, there’s…Mother’s Day!\nLove,\nElder Spencer Irvine"

    "text": "Querida Familia Irvine:\nAs for the overcoat, depends on how much it costs to send the coat.\nIf it’s a lot, I’ll just endure the cold because it’s not worth a fortune.\nAnd, P-days are too short to get everything done including shopping for coats.\nAs for packages, it’d be great!\nTalks on CD’s, music, and whatever you feel like sending.\nI still haven’t finished the food you sent me way back when, like the instant rice and stuff since the members feed us A LOT! Please don’t send me too much this time!\nPres. Goodrich probably said I’ll stay with my comp, who is amazing. I’m excited.\nStart the week off great, I love my investigators and I love teaching them with the Spirit.\nWe doubled attendance this week because Neira and I visited almost every single person in the chapel yesterday.\nSaturday was, by far, the best day even though it was the busiest ever!\nWe ended up going to a less active’s house, the Santillan’s, whose Christian daughter called us blasphemers not too long ago.\nI didn’t want to go, but Neira was like ‘c’mon Elder Irvine’ so we did.\nWe get there and knock on the door, the daughter opens the door and had us come in.\nWe found out that her mom, the member, nearly died half and hour ago with severe drops in sugar level.\nAnd, her mom prayed for the missionaries to come.\nHer daughter knew it was an answer to her mother’s prayer.\nWe helped her move some things around the home, and sat down to talk.\nThey gave us tamales and then, the bombshell.\nThe daughter said that her trials are overwhelming, and that she wants to read the Bible and gain comfort from it.\nShe asked us gasp to teach her from the scriptures.\nWhat a change!\nThe first time I went there I nearly cried because she called us blasphemers, and now she wants us to teach her? Wow!\nSo that was a pleasant surprise (understatement).\nWe went to another investigator’s home, not home, so we went to give a blessing to a member in Canyon Country and took a 15 minute nap.\nIt was good, because we needed it later.\nZipped in, blessed her son with a blessing of comfort.\nThe mother is a perfectionist, poor kid, she was mad he wasn’t being the #1 student and was just being pretty mean in my opinion.\nSo we zipped over to another member, who is really sick.\nWe gave her a blessing and left to find a referral.\nWe got lost a bit, and finally found it. Not home.\nAlong the way, we stopped the car when we saw two black hoodlums walking.\nWe asked them directions, ‘Hey, do you know where West Ness is?’ and the kid closest to us shook and freaked out.\nThen they said, ‘Naw, man’ and we finally found it.\nIt was hilarious! If you saw his reaction, oh my goodness! That made my day.\nQuick lunch then off to contact in the park IN THE COLD. It was at least 40 plus wind chill.\nBut, we found an elect family.\nThis entire week, we’ve had some trouble finding the elect.\nWe set an hour apart in a specific place to find an elect, and we finally got one on Saturday!\nWe’re going to teach them in the next few days.\nFrozen, but excited, we found another recent convert and cleared up some of his doubts about priesthood, then finally went back to Newhall, 30 minutes away.\nLess active wasn’t home, so we went to eat dinner…which was just fantastic!\nEating dinner at the Umana’s is like going to a buffett, he gives us a LOT of food!\nAnd, he’s an RM so he knows what’s up with the ward.\nHe’s our ear, our inside man.\nWe finished the ward mission plan on his comp and gave it to him.\nWe got to the Jaimes’ home 30 minutes late, but our member fellowshippers were there! I love familia Ceja! We taught and testified about the Holy Ghost, and the Spirit was strong.\nWe got home, planned, and crashed really fast.\nI have never been so tired than I was Saturday.\nAnd guess what, the mother, daughter, and son came to church yesterday!\nThe oldest son is in Mexico with the soccer team and the dad was busy.\nBut, they are progressing! I was so happy to see them yesterday.\nThe Lord is blessing us with the elect, two days in a row, and we are still going to go out there and do His work. Regardless of what happens,\nI’m going to be His representative and going to do His work and His will.\nSomething my comp pointed out to me was that we are literally God’s representatives, that people reject us, they reject God.\nWe can’t disobey the rules, because we are in His stead.\nIt’s as if we are Him when we are in the mission field.\nIt’s motivated me to be a better missionary, to actually make good contacts, teaching moments, whatever you call them, on the streets.\nMy brothers and sisters are waiting for this Gospel, I just have to testify and teach.\nWhat a great message, what a marvelous work!\nI am sad to say, I am hitting my 6 month mark.\nI am sad, I don’t want time to fly so fast!\nI want to go back to the beginning and do it over again!\nI don’t want to look back and say…if I only had done this…or that…if I only had the knowledge I have now.\nI love this mission, I love this work, I, most of all, love my Savior Jesus Christ.\nHe has blessed me with the gift of tongues, He has picked me up from the lowest points of the mission so far, and He has blessed me immensely.\nHow I love my Lord, my God! As Alma says, if I were an angel of God and go about with the trump of God!\nDad- I love you, my loving and righteous father. If only I could make you more proud, if only I could show you how much I miss you. Thank you for working hard, thank you for being who you are.\nMom- I love you, my exemplary mother and caregiver. I can’t say how much I appreciate your words, your packages, and most of all, your love. I miss you.\nSteven- Don’t miss church! I love you, my caring, loving, loyal, and most of all, worthy brother. You are my brother, and I know that you are the best brother I could ever have. I love you, and keep up the good work.\nGrandma- I love you, my always polite, courteous, humble, and unique grandmother. I hope that all is well, that you love your Japanese DVDs, and that you can look forward to my phone call soon. Only less than a month to go!\nKristy- I love you, just keep it up! It’s hard enough contacting for 3-4 hours, but the work will progress. I thought Spanish work is easy, it isn’t at all! The investigators will love you, the Lord loves you, and will bless you. The blessings are around the corner, as my mission president said. Just be yourself. You’d probably kick all the sister missionaries’ tail out here with all that hard work you do!\nI love you all, and I’ll talk to you soon.\nLove, Elder Irvine\nP.S. If you could send my companion Elder Sandoval a Christmas card or something, he’d appreciate it so much. I know he would appreciate a card from the best family in the world! Thank you!"
