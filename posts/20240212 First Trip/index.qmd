That time we traveled from Maryland to Utah  
How long ago was it?

We made the visit as a family. 
To Utah to attend a graduation.  
Then to visit Arizona.

The journey took several days, since we drove. 
My sister and I took turn driving.
My mom and dad in the back seats with your sister in the middle
You in the front middle seat.

We attended a graduation in Provo Utah

Then we drove to meet my sister in Scottsdale.

Thank you and your sister for coming with us on that journey many years ago.
You didn't have much choice.

You were only 6 months old.
So patient, demonstrating those qualities very early.

Thanks for being part of that journey many many years ago  
We enjoyed that time together as we drove out.

Many flew back home, leaving Grandpa and I to drive the Olds 88 back home.
It was good to drive with Grandpa as we drove through Texas and beyond.
We drove and reminisced through I-81 and rain.

Since then, we have enjoyed many more journeys with you.

But that first one, we all marveled how you and your sister were able to endure.
My mom and dad expressed their appreciation to you for travelling so well.

Thank you Spencer, for that memory from August of 1988.
