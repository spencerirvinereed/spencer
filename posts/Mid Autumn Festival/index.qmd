All cultures celebrate and give thanks during the harvest season.

The Wikipedia defines a Harvest Celebration as

> A harvest festival is an annual celebration that occurs around the time of the main harvest of a given region

For many in the northern Asia, the Harvest Festival is celebrated during the 8th Lunar Month, when the moon is full[^1].

[^1]: The Full Moon is when the Sun and the Moon are aligned on opposite sides of Earth, and 100% of the Moon's face is illuminated by the Sun, [link](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/moon/full-moon.html)

For Koreans, of my generation, 추석(秋夕, Autumn Evening), or 한가위(the great middle (of autumn)) is a time of gathering, celebrating, remembering of ancestors.

The gathering is according to family units at the hometown for at least 3 days.

It is time of great feast, fresh harvest along with items normally set aside for special occasions.

It is a celebration if the harvest was sufficient to last the winter months, or when the next harvest can be expected -- at least during the agrarian days.

Remembering the ancestors involves tidying up the grave and preparing a meal for the deceased and saying set phrases executing set movements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Normally, it is a time of anticipation and celebration, unless the person is one of over 8 million^[실향민의 숫자는 1985년 5백만명으로 집계됐으며, 2\~3세까지 합하면 8백만명에 이른다고 한다, [link](https://namu.wiki/w/%EC%8B%A4%ED%96%A5%EB%AF%BC)] 실향민 in South Korea.

실향민(失鄕民 / refugee), is also translated a `Displace People`. People who are unable to return to their homeland due to, usually, man-made, political boundaries.

Growing up, gathering during the Harvest Celebration, meant visiting the graves of the deceased and visiting the household with the oldest member of the clan.

Since my family migrated (or were refugees) from Northern part of Korea, the gathering was very small, the celebration was limited.
We talked of old home (老家) and we yearned for the day when we can travel to the ancestral home and meet the people with common heritage.

That dream is still is alive.

However the probability of its occurrence is small.
Even it was possible, what is the meaning of face to face meeting people with no interactions or knowledge of relationship -- for nearly 75 years.

Celebrating harvest celebration alone as a grown up was more challenging.
Everyone took the, mandatory time off and headed to their hometown.

I, on the other hand, went and visited my only relative in Seoul -- traveling in opposite direction than the vast majority of the population.

Living in the United States has been a dream of my parents.
Most of the time, I relish the label of refugee/immigrant.
A refugee within Korea followed by migration to the great land of America.

At times, especially during the time of family gathering to ancestral home, I wish to know the rest of people that I ought to know.

## Importance of Physical Gathering

Biblical patriarchs speaks of gathering unto the people. 
Similar expression are used in Korea, including the phrase,
`돌아가다`, return to where one originated from.

> 29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,[^2]

[^2]: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2049&version=KJV

Our physical, mortal existence ends with a burial - a literal and a symbolic gathering.
In Christianity, that symbolic burial of the body is followed by the literal gathering of spirits and souls, it is called the resurrection.

## Necessity of Spiritual Gathering

Approaching the latter half of life, contemplating the eventual death and transformation, I begin to wonder and as I prepare,

- Will we be gathered and organized by the family groups.
- What type of work will I be involved in
- How will wrongs and lack of experiences due to premature death be corrected and extended. 
- What type of learning and how will furthering of our understanding happen
