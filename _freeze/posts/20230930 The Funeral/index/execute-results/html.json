O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder Consider all the *worlds thy hands have made, I see the stars, I hear the* rolling thunder, Thy pow'r thru-out the universe displayed;\n\n\\[Chorus\\]\n\n*Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee, How great thou art! How great thou art! Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to thee, How great thou art! How great thou art!*\n\n2.  When thru the woods and forest glades I wander, And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees, When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze, \\[Chorus\\]\n\n3.  And when I think that God, his Son not sparing, Sent him to die, I scarce can take it in, That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing, He bled and died to take away my sin, \\[Chorus\\]\n\n4.  When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation, And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart! Then I shall bow in humble adoration And there proclaim, \"My God, how great thou art!\" \\[Chorus\\]\n\n## Families can be Together, Forever[^2]\n\n[^2]: https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/music/library/hymns/families-can-be-together-forever?lang=eng\n\nI have a fam'ly here on earth.\n\nThey are so good to me.\n\nI want to share my life with them through all eternity.\n\n\\[Chorus\\]\n\n*Fam'lies can be together forever*\n\n*Through Heav'nly Father's plan.*\n\n*I always want to be with my own family,*\n\n*And the Lord has shown me how I can.*\n\n*The Lord has shown me how I can.*\n\nWhile I am in my early years,\n\nI'll prepare most carefully,\n\nSo I can marry in God's temple for eternity.\n\n## Battle Hymn of the Republic[^3]\n\n[^3]: https://www.austincc.edu/dlauderb/1302/Lyrics/BattleHymnoftheRepublic.htm\n\nMine eyes have seen the glory Of the coming of the Lord; He is trampling out the vintage Where the grapes of wrath are stored; He hath loosed the fateful lightning Of His terrible swift sword; His truth is marching on.\n\nChorus\n\n*Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.*\n\nI have seen Him in the watchfires Of a hundred circling camps They have builded Him an altar In the evening dews and damps; I can read His righteous sentence By the dim and flaring lamps; His day is marching on.\n\n*Chorus Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.*\n\nHe has sounded forth the trumpet That shall never call retreat; He is sifting out the hearts of men Before His judgement seat; Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; Be jubilant, my feet; Our God is marching on.\n\n*Chorus Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!

And he has asked me to conduct.\n\nA warm thank you to Brandon Turley for playing the piano and to Bree Irvine. She'll be conducting the music.\n\nWe'll begin this service by saying hymn number #86, How Great Thou Art. Following we will have our opening prayer by Barry Turley.\n\n## Opening Prayer - Bary Turley\n\nOur Father in Heaven.\n\nWe are grateful for this opportunity. We have to come and celebrate, the life of Spencer Irvine.\n\nWe're grateful for the opportunity that we've had to be a part of his life. To feel of his spirit and to feel of his love.\n\nWe ask thee to, please bless us that we may be able to. Have thy peace and comfort with us as we strive to reconcile this tragic passing.\n\nPlease help us to, use it as a catalyst to. Become better. Better families,individuals and more Christ like -- as Spencer was.\n\nWe are grateful for the many blessings that Thou gives us for the gospel, For the Knowledge and comfort that we will one day be able to. See and be With him again, and\n\nWe say these things humbly in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.\n\n### Bishop McCormack\n\nWe have a few speakers this morning.\n\nFirst, the tribute to Spencer by his sister, Kristy Tidwell.\n\nWe will then pause to hear John and Sarah Gonzales singing my shepherd.\n\nFollowing the musical number, a eulogy will be given by Steven Irvine. Following Stephen, Alfredo Lopez, (Spencer's friend), will say a few words.\n\n### Kristy Irvine\n\nMy hope and prayer today is that the the spirit can be with me.\n\nTo help me get through this.\n\nIt took a long time for me to think about how I could give Spencer, a proper tribute to, who he was.\n\nMy dear brother Spencer left this mortality too soon, but not without making his mark in this world.\n\nHe lived his life in accordance with the principles that he knew to be true and aligned his life with the will of our savior Jesus Christ.\n\nI think that it can be said of him, that like Nephi\n\n> I glory in plainness,\\\n> I glory in truth, I glory in my Jesus, for he hath redeemed my soul.\n\nSpencer loved the Gospel of Jesus Christ and embodied it, and in all that he did. Even as a child, he could recognize true principles and devoted his life to the savior and our Heavenly Father.\n\nHe was a black and white kind of guy. He could see right. And he knew when things were wrong.\n\nOne of my favorite things that we talked about this week was, that even in preschool, when he was interviewed for a new story about missing school, he told the reporter that he missed school because he wanted to play.\n\nAnd those were facts.\n\nThere's a small section of a talk given by Michelle Craig that I would like to read because we can insert Spencer's name into it and see him in it, she says.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"When hard times come, I try to remember that I chose to follow Christ before I came to Earth and that challenges to my faith, my health and my endurance are all part of the reason I'm here.\n\nAnd I certainly should never think that today's trial calls into question God's love for me or let it turn my faith in him into doubt.\n\nTrials do not mean that the plan is failing.\n\nThey are part of the plan, meant to help me seek God.\n\nI become more like him when I endure patiently and hopefully like him when in agony.\n\nI pray more earnestly.\n\nJesus Christ was the perfect example of loving our father with all his heart, of doing his will and regardless of the cost, I want to follow his his example by doing the same\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSpencer embodied so many Christ-like attributes throughout his short time here on Earth.\n\nHe was full of faith in Jesus Christ.\n\nHe fully accepted him as his personal Savior and Redeemer, and looked to Him in all things.\n\nIn `Preach My Gospel`, which is a guide for all members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nIt says that faith leads to action, and when you have faith in Jesus Christ, you accomplish what the Lord wants you to accomplish. And you help bring about good in your own life and the lives of others.\n\nSpencer was always doing good in his life. He served others.\n\nHe remembered birthdays. He apologized for not remembering birthdays.\n\nAnd he was always one to help when needed. Spencer was full of hope. He hoped for a better future for himself and Meg, and always look forward, not back.\n\nHe was patient, optimistic and persevered through his multiple surgeries, injuries, his recent diagnosis.\n\nAnd in every trial that he faced, his eye was fixed firmly upon the Savior.\n\nPresident James E Faust taught, `hope is the anchor of our souls`.\n\nSpencer lived his life full of hope.\n\nA man once asked Jesus which is the great commandment in the law.\n\nJesus replied,\n\n> Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment, and the second is like unto it. Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.\n\nSpencer did this his entire life.\n\nHe put the Lord first.\n\nHis friends knew what he stood for and what he wouldn't say or do.\n\nSpencer listened to those around him and loved them unconditionally.\n\nHe served a full time mission in California, and his letters were always full of love for those around him.\n\nWhenever I would text Spencer, he was quick to offer a kind word.\n\nHe supported me with love and was slow to anger.\n\nHis life was a life of charity, the pure love of Christ was part of who he was.\n\nSpencer was a true disciple of Christ.\n\nElder De Feo. said in a talk entitled `Pure Love`, the true sign of every disciple of Jesus Christ said[^4].\n\n[^4]: [link](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/04/pure-love-the-true-sign-of-every-true-disciple-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng)\n\n> True disciples love to submit themselves to the Lord with peace in their heart. They are humble and submissive because they love him. They have faith to fully accept his will, not only in what he does, but also in how and when.\n\n> True disciples know that the real blessings are not always what they want, but rather what the Lord wants for them.\n\nHis humility and willingness to submit to the will of The Lord was and is inspiring.\n\nSpencer went through periods of unemployment which to us is very disappointing and many when faced with this challenge can become despondent and even quick to anger with the Lord for not helping answer prayers for good employment.\n\nSpencer did everything that he could to provide for himself and Meg, even taking jobs that were not equal to his education or talents.\n\nBut they were jobs that would allow him to provide. His humility and submission to the Lord, yielded great results with a job that Spencer truly loved.\n\nElder De Feo also said `pure love is the true sign of every true disciple of Jesus Christ`.\n\nI'm sure many of you have memories of Spencer embodying this statement. His love was pure, it was unfettered from judgment and hostility.\n\nHe was a happy person who loved unconditionally.\n\nHe laughed with so many, he welcomed all.\n\nHe threw himself into youth activities and was always the first to offer a smile, tell a good joke and ask if anyone needed help.\n\nSpencer loved his family.\n\nHe devoted his time to his sweetheart, Meg, and gave her everything that he could offer and the circumstances that they lived in.\n\nHe loved everything about his nieces and nephews.\n\nAnd would gush over their photos and celebrate their accomplishments and encourage them when I would tell him of a struggle in their life.\n\nIn closing, I want to share a few thoughts on the resurrection. As we look to that day with longing and hope of seeing our dear Spencer again\n\nThe following is taken from a talk called `Sunday Will Come`, by Elder Wirthlin[^5].\n\n[^5]: [link](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2006/10/sunday-will-come?lang=eng)\n\n> President Joseph F. Smith said \"that those from whom we have to part here, we will meet again and see as they are. We will meet the same identical being that we associated with here in the flesh.\"\n\n> President Spencer W. Kimball amplified this when he said, \"I am sure that if we can imagine ourselves at our very best, physically, mentally, spiritually, that is the way we will come back.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\"When Christ rose from the grave, becoming the first fruits of the Resurrection, He made that gift available to all. And with that sublime act, He softened the devastating, consuming sorrow that gnaws at the souls of those who have lost precious loved ones.\n\nI think of how dark that Friday was when Christ was lifted up on the cross.\n\nOn that terrible Friday the earth shook and grew dark. Frightful storms lashed at the earth.\n\nThose evil men who sought His life rejoiced. Now that Jesus was no more, surely those who followed Him would disperse. On that day they stood triumphant.\n\nOn that day the veil of the temple was rent in twain.\n\nMary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Jesus, were both overcome with grief and despair. The superb man they had loved and honored hung lifeless upon the cross.\n\nOn that Friday the Apostles were devastated. Jesus, their Savior---the man who had walked on water and raised the dead---was Himself at the mercy of wicked men. They watched helplessly as He was overcome by His enemies.\n\nOn that Friday the Savior of mankind was humiliated and bruised, abused and reviled.\n\nIt was a Friday filled with devastating, consuming sorrow that gnawed at the souls of those who loved and honored the Son of God.\n\nI think that of all the days since the beginning of this world's history, that Friday was the darkest.\n\nBut the doom of that day did not endure.\n\nThe despair did not linger because on Sunday, the resurrected Lord burst the bonds of death. He ascended from the grave and appeared gloriously triumphant as the Savior of all mankind.\n\nAnd in an instant the eyes that had been filled with ever-flowing tears dried. The lips that had whispered prayers of distress and grief now filled the air with wondrous praise, for Jesus the Christ, the Son of the living God, stood before them as the first fruits of the Resurrection, the proof that death is merely the beginning of a new and wondrous existence.\n\nEach of us will have our own Fridays---those days when the universe itself seems shattered and the shards of our world lie littered about us in pieces. We all will experience those broken times when it seems we can never be put together again. We will all have our Fridays.\n\nBut I testify to you in the name of the One who conquered death---Sunday will come. In the darkness of our sorrow, Sunday will come.\n\nNo matter our desperation, no matter our grief, Sunday will come. In this life or the next, Sunday will come.\"\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy hope is that as Spencer passed through the veil, he could he could hear the words of Paul in his mind.\n\n> The time in my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I have kept the faith.\n\nMay we all remember our dear friend Spencer and the compass that he used to guide his life, the Savior, Jesus Christ.\n\nMay we take the example that Spencer set for us and following the Savior that we may invite the Savior more fully into our lives and willingly give our shortcomings to him that he may help us be perfect in Him.\n\nMy testimony is that Sunday will come that glorious day when we will be reunited with those we love and rejoice in the great gift that the Savior has given us through his sacrifice in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Steven Irvine\n\nSpencer was a special person. \n\nAs you heard from Kristy, he was the most Christ like. \n\nKind, caring, loving person that I know. \n\nHe was the best older brother. \nHe was the best friend. \nAnd the best example, that I could have. \n\nThis week has been a week of reflection for me\n\nI tried to figure out and appreciate how much my life was influenced by my older brother and the 31 years that I was able to spend with him. \n\nI realized  I attribute so much of who I am to who he was\nAnd how much I wanted to be like him. \n\nGrowing up, I shared a room with him and we always talked before going to bed in our little bunk beds.\n\nAll of my hobbies, all of my knowledge came from his influence.\nAnd because he loved history and civil war, so I know about Antietam and Gettysburg \nBecause he was so obsessed with those things and we'd go on these trips over to Virginia and have fun as a family.\n\nBecause that's what Spencer loved.\nI just wanted to be there with him and I wanted to learn about these that he loved. \n\nMy love for all sports comes from his nerdiness.\n\nAll thosee stats that he knew and I'm going to miss texting \n\n> hey, what do you think about this guy \n\nAnd he would text me back all these stats. \n\nThat's just who he was. \n\nHe was so loving and knowledgeable.\nHe just gave everything his all,\nI always wanted to follow in his footsteps. \n\nI wanted to be the college football fan that could talk football with my brother. \nI wanted to play the video games, growing up with my brother and my sister, and have fun playing Mario Kart with them. \n\nI just wanted to be him. \n\nThat's what what I've realized over this last week.\nI really wanted to be my brother. \n\nBecause he just set such a good example for me. \n\nHow to be man \nHow to be an adult. \nHow to be a spouse. \n\nBecause he adored Meg and he treated her like a queen. \nAnd I thought to myself one day I want to love somebody like that because I saw how much he loved her. \n\nHe was everything I could ask for from an older brother. \nHe was truly the best example. \nHe had the best laugh, even though it was a little too loud. \n\nWe all loved it.\n\nYou can read all the hundreds of Facebook comments about him and his contagious laughter, with his big smile and how it just came out of his chest. \n\nAnd you knew exactly where he was at all times.\n\nHe had so much fun with everything that he did and he just loved life so much. \n\nAnd there's a word that I was thinking of. \nHow do I how do I explain who Spencer was? \nTo somebody who didn't know my older brother. \n\nThe word is `Vigor`. \nAnd that's just how Spencer lived. \n\nHe lived with so much vigor, he loved life, he loved everybody.\n\nHe was everybody's best friend. \nHe talked to people on the airplane. \nWho does that? \nBut that was Spencer.\n\nHe was everybody's best friend. \nHe always had a smile on his face. \n\nIf you look at any of those pictures, you knew he was a happy person. \nAnd he was so Christ like.\n\nHe was so loving. \nHe was so caring. \nAnd it's just as my sister said. \nHe leaves such a big hole in our family. \n\nAnd now, as I try to compare myself to him,  \n\nHe would call my parents out of the blue to check up on them.\n\nI call my parents to get something from them, or ask them a question.\nBut Spencer cared about how my dad's day was going.\nWhile I was like, \n\n> oh, I could call my dad today, I guess, but... \n\nHe just he loved them so much and he was just such a good son. \n\nHe was my dad's best friend. \nHe always thought about them. \nHe always thought about other people, even when he was sick last Wednesday. \n\nOut of the blue, he called me -- four times. \nI thought this was strange.\n\nI was working and I missed the calls.\nI thought it was weird that he called me four times and he left me a voicemail. \n\nAnd the voicemail starts off with. \n\n> Love you little bro. Thank you so much for praying for us and all the\nsupport. \n\nAnd then he ends it with\n\n> love you so much. Take care, Steven. \n\nAnd I didn't at the time, I didn't think much of it \nBecause well, we will have time with him.\nBut, why did he call me? \nOn a Wednesday during a work day. \n\nWhy did he feel like he had to call me so many times and I ended up\ncalling him back and we had a really great chat for 45 minutes. \n\nThat was the last time I spoke to him. \n\nBut he knew somehow that he needed to leave me this message that I'm going to cherish for the rest of my life. \n\nHe knew that he needed to call me then because he wasn't going to have an opportunity again.\n\nHe knew that he just needed to talk to me. \nSomehow some way Spencer knew. \n\nDespite feeling low, despite being bloated and having pain and being on painkillers. Knowing that there was a very grim prognosis for him, he\ncalled me in the middle of the week, last Wednesday. \n\nTo tell me that he loved me.\n\nBecause that's just who he was. \n\nI couldn't imagine my life without him. \n\nNo matter what I did, he was always the prouder, older brother. \n\nEven when he was unemployed and struggling and really challenged.\nI got a job and I started moving up the ladder and he was always so proud of me.\n\nAnd looking back\n\nIf I were in his shoes, I'd be thinking,\n\n> what a little punk. \nWhy does he get a job. \nHow is he doing this and I'm not? \nI have the master's degree. \n\nThere would be so many things going through my mind of how I would\nhave reacted to these negative situations.\n\nBut Spencer didn't. \n\nEvery time I texted him, he was always so proud of me. \nHe was always so happy for me. \n\nI don't know how I would have reacted to all that. \nI don't know how I would have been non judgmental. \nOr not angry? \nAt all of these circumstances that happened to me. \n\nBut no matter what, he was just such a trooper. \nHe was always so positive in the middle of all. \nWhether his diagnosis or Doctor visits, he would call me and tell me. \n\n> You know what? I'm going to beat this thing. I'm going to stay positive. I'm going to do it. And we're going to beat it. \n\nHe had so much hope. \nAnd so much love.\n\nI remember one of the last things he told me on that Wednesday.\n\nHow amazing our family has been for him. \nHow much support his friends and family have given him all across the world. \nHow amazing his wife was for doing everything for him, taking him to the ER all those times and bearing that burden with him.\n\nAs I look throughout the years and I think of how amazing of an\nolder brother he was. \n\nEvery situation that I would have reacted negatively, he\nreacted positively. \n\nEvery person that he met, he left with a good impression\nWhen I probably would have been judgmental.\n\nHe was a better man. \n\nHe was so positive. \nSo Christ like\nSo loving. \n\nHe set a good example for me, despite everything that he faced.\nHe was always encouraging me, always trying to teach me and be\nthe supportive older brother that he knew that he needed to be. \n\nAnd last Saturday, before we came down to Arizona on Sunday, for the first time\nin years, I watched college football in our basement.\n\nI said to myself, \n\n> Wow, this would be really fun if Spencer gets his chemo treatment and he feels good\nenough, one day I'll fly him up here so we can have another college football\nSaturday that we used to have growing up. \n\nI felt a little bit of Spencer next to me. \nLooking back at it, it feels very surreal that I almost felt like I had him with me.\nFor that one day, the day before he passed, I decided to watch college\nfootball.\nThat I decided to do that one thing that he loves so much doing with\nme. \n\nAnd I felt him and that a little part of him was there with me\nI will cherish that moment for the rest of my life.\n\nI love my brother so much. \n\nHe's such a good example to me. \nHe was the most Christlike person that I know. \nAnd I will miss him dearly.\n\nAnd I want to close this with my testimony. \nI know that I'm going to see him again. \nAnd I can't wait to see him and get one of those big bear hugs that he always gives. \n\nBecause I'm already missing those. \n\nI know that he's watching over us. \nAnd I know that the plan of salvation is real and I can't wait to see him again. \n\nI say that in the name of Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<script src=\"https://utteranc.es/client.js\"\n        repo=\"https://github.com/spencerirvinereed/blogComment\"\n        issue-term=\"pathname\"\n        theme=\"github-light\"\n        crossorigin=\"anonymous\"\n        async>\n</script>\n```\n",
