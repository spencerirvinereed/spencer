<p>Dear Irvine Family:</p>
<p>Well, the weather calls for rain to move in.</p>
<p>So it’s a bit misty and moist over here, and it’s a little chilly at nights again.</p>
<p>Reminds me of back home actually.</p>
<p>It is a bit strange for me, but it’s California!</p>
<p>I hope you all had a great President’s Day, because it was a pretty chill p-day.</p>
<p>Went to a member’s house to throw a birthday party for one of the elders in the zone and then off to play some basketball in the afternoon.</p>
<p>I really need to scale my basketball intensity back because my back hurts a bit after a good and hard game of basketball.</p>
<p>I’m getting better at shooting (finally!) but it’s not really good overall to have a sore back for the rest of the day and a bit the next morning.</p>
<p>Thank you for your package, I love the Field’s goodies!</p>
<p>As for pictures, I’m saving them up to put on a CD to send to you, because if I send a memory card they’ll get erased.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>But, I had my first baptism!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a crazy day and apparently that’s how most baptism days go.</p>
<p>We got the baptism all planned out on Tuesday and used a member’s computer on Saturday to type the program up.</p>
<p>It was a bit hectic when we had to use the computer in the clerk’s office after church to print copies of the program.</p>
<p>Rushed to drop the other elders off then off to fill up the baptismal font then off to a lunch appointment then back to get the other elders to get them to the baptism and got there about 20 minutes before people were going to arrive.</p>
<p>I was so nervous we were going to be late!</p>
<p>So I hurried up and rushed and dressed in my whites, and just waited.</p>
<p>A good amount of the ward came out with less than a day’s notice (because we finalized the baptism this past week).</p>
<p>I was so nervous, and it didn’t help that one of the local members asked me,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>‘so, are you nervous?’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and I was like</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>‘heck yes I am it’s my first baptism!’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I actually memorized the baptismal scripture in the morning (not that hard) and right before the actual getting into the font I was thinking,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>‘Habiendo sido comisionado…’ in my head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hermanno <code>DLC</code>, gave a great talk on baptism.</p>
<p>Then, a spectacular talk by Hermano <code>PP</code> on the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>Too bad it wasn’t geared for a 10 year old girl, but I loved it.</p>
<p>And right before the service started, my friend Elder <code>H</code> told me,</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>‘don’t drop her’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ha. Just great!</p>
<p>So I walked down into the font and I just blocked everything out of my mind.</p>
<p>I said the prayer then I pushed her under. I hesitated after the first push then just completely immersed her.</p>
<p>I walked inside the bathroom to change, and I said a prayer thanking the Lord for His mercy to use me as His tool.</p>
<p>I didn’t even know that I was going to baptize her until Friday night and I didn’t sleep well Friday or Saturday (I didn’t pay attention to the mother’s response when we were going over the program that Tuesday- so much for listening skills).</p>
<p>It was amazing!</p>
<p>I just felt so great! I was really blessed that the program went really well and that I was able to baptize someone.</p>
<p>I just love it.</p>
<p>And something funny that happened too was that our piano player is Elder <code>S</code> from Seoul, Korea.</p>
<p>Our ward mission leader went to tell him that he was going to start the meeting (Elder <code>S</code> was doing the prelude) and said</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>‘vamos a comenzar’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Funny thing is, Elder <code>S</code> only knows English and Korean. He was like, ‘huh, what?’</p>
<p>Then my pal Elder <code>H</code> flew in and told Elder <code>S</code> that meant, we’re going to start.</p>
<p>It was funny for me.</p>
<p>I absolutely loved it, and I can’t wait to see if the Lord will bless me with more baptisms in the mission I am serving for him.</p>
<p>And yes, I did give her the necklace.</p>
<hr>
<p>These last few weeks have been depressing.</p>
<p>I didn’t have the Spirit with me much, because of my own faults and weaknesses and not being exactly obedient or hopeful in receiving blessings.</p>
<p>A bit pessimistic and human, you could say.</p>
<p>But, I have gotten back on track.</p>
<p>It’s really rough because the other pair of elders that I room with are not very obedient and play music that doesn’t invite the Spirit, they’re pretty irreverent, and it really hurt me spiritually.</p>
<p>It was a bit rough, and I do not look forward to having an apostate companion because it might just make me want to go home.</p>
<p>I was a little depressed these past weeks because of the environment that I’m in.</p>
<p>On top of that, my comp is a bit trunky, well he’s trunky so he could listen to whatever music and to some small extent date girls, but he’s still working so it’s good.</p>
<p>He’ll end his mission working, no doubt.</p>
<p>So a combination of things have been happening, but have only taught me to be patient, longsuffering, and kind.</p>
<p>Not exactly me, but the Lord is teaching me in a hard way. And I felt my language suffer a bit since the Spirit wasn’t really with me, but also because I was not in a great mood all the time and didn’t study as much as I should.</p>
<p>It’s been rough, but it’s getting better slowly.</p>
<p>And, these other guys might be moved out and we might take over their area, but we’ll see what happens.</p>
<p>It just means a lot more work! Yes!</p>
<hr>
<p>This week was hectic…if I would tell you all it’d take forever.</p>
<p>But, we had zone conference and a trip to the temple and were busy all week.</p>
<p>It was good, but it is very tiring!</p>
<p>And I just love the temple!</p>
<p>But now we’re only going 3 times a year so it’s a bummer instead of once every 3 weeks.</p>
<p>But, it means it’s more special.</p>
<p>It should be, but now it will be even more special.</p>
<p>And also, the wonderful Sister <code>F</code> had us over for dinner to wish me a happy birthday, so it was a very strange moment without my family.</p>
<p>But, I’d do anything for them!</p>
<p>They even made me a delicious strawberry and lemon-icing cake. It was so awesome! So I had a good and busy birthday!</p>
<p>The people that we’re teaching are progressing.</p>
<p>And, the <code>J</code>s came for the first time in almost a month (though late and gave me a scare), and our baptism girl Lesley also came late (really giving me a scare).</p>
<p>Also, another investigator came (they weren’t even home for our last appointment with them) and a former investigator came.</p>
<p>So we had 7 investigators without really doing much.</p>
<p>It was really like a wake-up call.</p>
<p>It was as if the Lord just said to me, ’wake up, have faith, go to work.</p>
<p>And learn from this experience.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If the elect hear His voice, they’ll come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow. I was really pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>I am being so blessed right now…it is truly humbling.</p>
<p>The work is progressing, and I am seeing how good this area can become.</p>
<p>Yes, the ward has its multiple problems but it could be improved and replenished with new blood. I really would be curious to see what happens as the months roll on.</p>
<p>I love you all, and keep safe.</p>
<p>Love, Elder Irvine</p>
