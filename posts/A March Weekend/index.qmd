My sister in Mesa said,

When someone in AZ invites, I am on my way.  

Especially, if the invitation is before Spring Equinox.

Prior to arriving, told Don that we should watch a spring baseball game.

He and Spencer made arrangements.

And just like that we were at the Diablo Stadium.
Watching the `Texas Rangers` play the `LA (California) Angels`

What a venue for a baseball game, or any event.  
I had visited this complex during my traveling days.  
I wanted to watch a game in person

We were like foreigners following their teams.
Traveling abroad to watch them play -- even if it a spring practice game.

But it wasn't the game that entertained and enlightened us.

For we had a personal baseball commentator, a historian, and the current event interpreter sitting with us.

Spencer had us relaxed, think about ourselves and in turn think about life.

While sitting in an open stadium, feeling the sun with bit of clouds on an early desert spring afternoon.

There was no need for a preparation, just be there and enjoy the conversation.

Thank you Don.
Thank you Spencer
