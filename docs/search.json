    "text": "Our beloved husband, son, brother, and uncle Spencer Reed Irvine, passed away peacefully on the evening of 24 September 2023 in Scottsdale, Arizona after a courageous bout with cancer.\nSpencer was born on 13 February 1988 in Rockville, Maryland.\nHe excelled in all areas of endeavors in life, yet he was humble and a friend to all.\nHe embodied a gentle kindness to all and was a source of many excellent conversations.\nHe graduated from Brigham Young University, with an International Relations degree.\nHe obtained a Master of Public Administration from George Washington University.\nHe served in the California San Fernando Mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.\n\nHis hobbies and enjoyment included history, sport analytics, writing in areas of policies and politics, these shaped his life.\nHis talent for writing came from an accurate assessment of himself, grounded in his faith in Jesus Christ, and his surroundings.\nOften drawing and building upon an initial assessment then rigorously testing his thesis and rewriting as many times as necessary to satisfy his high standard.\nPerhaps he gained this skill through his father, Don, and also his grandfather Reed.\nBoth of whom adored Spencer and influenced his outlook and shaped his core.\nFrom his mother, Young Kang Irvine, Spencer learned hard work and perseverance – a first generation Korean immigrant.\nSpencer had great interest in the service of Grandpa Kang in the Korean War and had researched into the battles that Grandpa was involved in.\nWhether the setting was academic, religion, or work, Spencer applied all his faculties and energy.\nAnd most responded because they all felt his sincerity and love, which Spencer was blessed with in abundance.\n\nMany select and establish their North Star and an internal compass, and means to reckon and keep track of passage of time to guide their journey in this life.\nSpencer was gifted with an absolute and abiding True North and built himself a never deviating compass, and fashioned a perpetual time keeping method – all based on his faith in Jesus Christ, an understanding of the Will of the Father, and immense love for his fellow travelers.\nHe knew the purpose of this life, to love others as they need to be loved, without pre-condition or judgment.\nForever grateful that we got to know him and feel his love, taking a part in this journey together.\nWe have lost a guide, and the pain persists.\nHe was a leader that showed how to comfort and heal one another.\nSpencer is survived by his love of life Meg Nuñez Irvine, loving parents Don and Young, siblings Kristy (Tyler) and Steven (Bree).\nThe funeral services will be held on Saturday, 30 September 2023, 10AM.\n(Viewing will be from 9AM to 9:45AM)\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at 3920 N 44th Pl, Phoenix, AZ 85018.

    "text": "This area needs a lot of improvement, so that’s why I’m here I guess.\nIt’s so amazing though! Much prettier than the San Fernando Valley for sure.\nWhen I got to the area the first week, Elder N???ra told me that he asked mission president to send him one of the hardest working missionaries that he has.\nI was touched to hear that from Elder N???ra, because before I came here I had some doubts about my abilities, my purpose, if I was doing something wrong…but I’m very excited to be here now!\nThe investigators here are almost (casi) golden!\nJust a few commitments that they have to keep, but we’re working on them.\nOne family, the J??mes, are super golden!\nThe father can’t read, so we gave him Book of Mormon CD’s so he can listen to them.\nBut, his family reads the Book of Mormon. I love them so much!\nWe have a great fellowshipping couple, the C???’s (literally means eyebrow), and they bring the Spirit with them.\nHno. J??mes said that\n\nhe feels something different when we’re here, that when the missionaries come there is peace and joy in their home.\n\nTears welled up in my eyes and I was overwhelmed by the Spirit. Hna. J??mes cried a little too, I could see her wipe away some tears at the end.\nElder N???ra then testified that it was the Holy Ghost that was with us, and that it is testifying to them that what we teach is from God.\nThey have the best potential out of all of our investigators.\nBefore I came here, we had 5 investigators in Arleta.\nNow, we have about 3 possibly golden, and a lot of potentials and ‘alright’ investigators.\nReflecting and talking about my previous area with my new comp makes me realize that I still have a lot to work on to receive these blessings.\nAnother family, the M??cia’s, are amazing! They have a lot to learn, but they are looking for the truth.\nThey studied with the Jehovah’s Witnesses for a long time, but they stopped hearing them to hear us.\nThey had some deep questions, like is Jesus Christ Jehovah?\nSo we’re adjusting our lessons to ask them to believe on faith that what we teach is of God.\nThey’ve studied the Bible, and they know a good amount in my opinion.\nThe bishop is helping us out along with his wife, that was pretty sweet when they came and testified of what we taught.\nBut, Bishop A???da has a lot to learn still, he’s still learning the ropes of being bishop.\nThe second counselor is an RM, and he’s an excellent member.\nMarried, has two girls, and has a solid testimony. Hno. U???a is excited about missionary work, because he’s seen how important it is to the church’s progress in this ward.\nWe noticed that the bishop focuses on less actives, so we’re going to make an outline of what a ward mission plan should be then give it to Hno. U???a to submit to the bishopric.\nHe’s had some great experiences in the mission field!\nWe have a potential, whose life has fallen apart.\nHis wife left him, he has two children, his oldest (son) is on drugs, his youngest has no one to take care for her except her mother, he is alone!\nI know I’m here for a reason, to bring these ‘great news’, that what Gospel means literally, to him and to other people like him!\nOh, how I love the mission!\n Our ward needs a ton of help.\nThe records haven’t been updated, so we have a lot of people (apparently, by word of Hno. U???a) that have moved.\nDoesn’t help the person in charge of it is semi-inactive (the J??sen’s) and apparently feels excluded by Latinos because he (the husband) is American and his wife is Dominican. Argh!\nBut, we do have a lot of RM’s. But, we don’t have the support of the priesthood at all.\nWe prepare the Sacrament, we bless the Sacrament, we teach Gospel Doctrine sometimes, the sisters teach Primary…we do almost everything!\nI thought that was only in South America! But, we can see that the work needs to progress, they’re people here ready to hear us!\nJust get to work…and it’s going to be slow, but it’ll work out in the end.\nI know it will, as long as the Spirit will lift us and strengthen us.\nYesterday, it was a great sacrament meeting.\nAll six of us missionaries bore our testimonies along with our spiritual conversion story.\nWe all went up, and it was great to see the happiness in the expressions of the members.\nI have been blessed with the gift of tongues.\nIt says so in my patriarchial blessing, and I know that when I speak, the Lord is guiding me to say what I need to say.\nIt’s hard to keep the language up sometimes since my comp likes to us English (but we can converse normally in Spanish) but not as much as Sandoval liked to us English.\nI feel my learning is expanding now.\nIt’s just I have to make language study a priority or my comp will schedule appointments during language study time. Never a good thing.\nAfter I bore my testimony, and how I knew this Church is of God, the members thanked us all for our testimonies.\nThey felt the Spirit.\nAnd, everyone was impressed by my Spanish.\nTo which I always say, I studied for 7 years before, the Lord is blessing me, I love being here.\nIt’s hard to not compare oneself to others, and I’m working on that.\nAt times I can get a big head, but I remember that this is the Lord’s work and I’m only an instrument.\nJust imagine, natives love my Spanish and I only have 3 months in the field…the Lord’s hand is in my life.\nI’ve been studying the Book of Mormon recently, and I’m impressed how faithful Nephi is to the Lord.\nNever murmured, never turned away, never asked ‘why me?’, but faithfully obeyed His will.\nNo wonder the Primary sings about him so much.\nI love one scripture, which was given in a talk by John Bytheway (great speaker by the way…haha).\n1st Nephi 11:17, when Nephi was talking to the Spirit. To paraphrase the verse, The Spirit asked what he knew about the condescension of God? To which Nephi said,\n\nI know God loves his children, but I do not know the meaning of all things.\n\nWe may never know why things are happening, but we know God loves EACH and EVERY one of us.\nWe can’t see his reasons why, but we know that God loves us.\nNo matter what happens, no matter what becomes of us, we know that there is a purpose in all the things we are going through.\nI suggest his book and/or talk, 5 Scriptures that Will Get You Through Almost Everything, or something like that. One great talk.\nI’m on the mission, being constantly tired and at times confused in my lessons, to learn.\nI’m with a veteran companion to learn how to be a leader.\nI’m in this area to teach families and bring them to Christ.\nHow can I know that I am setting these people on the path to the Celestial Kingdom?\nAs Pres. Eyring said, you know when the Spirit testifies through you in lessons, that when you love the people so much the Spirit will be brought into your lessons so strongly you can’t deny his presence.\nHow do I know?\nThe pure love of Christ and the hope that they will make it.\nIf the Spirit touches them and they are converted by the Spirit and Book of Mormon, you have done your part.\nWhat great comfort that gives me!\nHow do I know? By the Spirit. How do I know?\nIf they have a testimony of the Book of Mormon.\nI learned about the Pre-Existence two weeks ago, and I want to share some thoughts that I’ve had about it ever since.\nI’ll have to send you the scriptures, because I don’t have it with me right now.\nBut I know, after studying this topic, that we did live with God before this life. We were one of the chosen (Abraham saw it as did Joseph F. Smith in D&C 138), we were called before the foundation of this world, we were one of those who were victorious against Lucifer and his angels.\nWhat a great blessing it is to know we are special children of God, called forth to come here today, to lay the foundation of a great work.\nI know that I lived with God before.\nI progressed, but not as fast as others.\nI learned, but not as well as others.\nBut I know, I know that God lives. I know that God loves me. I know that God wants me here. I know that this work is leading so many people to Him, in His time, and I love being His instrument.\nA friend wrote me and reminded me to not be discouraged, because I am a part of this great work. I know God loves me, and every day is a testimony of His love for all his children.\nThe work is hard.\nInvestigators lie to us all the time, and we still love them.\nBut, the work will progress. I know it will. Just a little more love, a little more sacrifice, then we will receive blessings.\nMom- Thank you for your love. I love you.\nPlease, read the scriptures and bear your testimony as often as you can.\nYou will only grow in your testimony and in your gospel knowledge.\nDad- I love you. For your example, your dedication, your devotion, your faith. I hope you are proud of me, because I am proud of you.\nKristy- Keep up the good work. God loves you. God wants you to work. God wants you to keep being faithful and obedient, then the blessings will come. Numbers don’t matter, it is YOU who matters the most. I love you. I wish you the best.\nSteven- I love you, my ‘little’ but taller brother. Listen to the counsels of the apostles, prepare now! Prepare now for the mission! It is your calling! That’s why you’re here right now! If you have time, listen or read John Bytheway’s “What I Wish I Knew Before My Mission”, because I know that I wish I knew these things before I hit the MTC. Keep up the grades, keep the faith, use your priesthood worthily.\nGrandma- I love you, my beloved grandmother. Your life is full of sacrifice, and I love you for all you’ve done for me. God loves you. God wants you to be happy. This life isn’t the end of everything, it is only the beginning. I love you Grandma, and Happy Birthday!\nGosh, I wish I knew Korean! I need to learn when I get back! And, my favorite scripture is yet to be determined, I’ll get to you on that in my letter. Thanks for everything!\nI love you all, and I hope all is well in Zion!\nLove, Elder Irvine"

Your time on this earth may have been short, but your wonderful memories will remain with us forever.\nOur lives are extra special for having been blessed with your wonderful presence.\nYou will be so dearly missed.\nSoar high, Spence.
